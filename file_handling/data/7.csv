"Positive","How is it only 6,000 per month?  The 8.37 is per host, with 4 host minimum which means the cost is really 24.00+ per hour."

"Positive","I dunno, that Musk guy has a much better hair line now.."
"Negative","*Oh god.*  I cannot believe I did not remember that the snapshot contains ALL the info up to date. I remember now a similar lesson in my personal lab...   Not that it would have helped considering he went ahead and did it without a backup before I even knew what was going on.  He's saying that he deleted it through the vCenter GUI. While I agree that he should have been less hasty in deleting the snapshot, what do you make of the message that the VM has reverted to the snapshot seemingly without manual interference ?"

"Negative","It feels as though the SVN 1.5 developers took a &quot;She'll be right&quot; approach  So over this lolpanda system."
"Negative","I had not tried that, but I just tried it and it typed the password correctly.  I figured something similar might be happening (this keyboard has done some weird stuff in the past, but normally not with typing), so I tried configuring the password network information through the iDRAC virtual console, but had the same issue.  Not a bad idea though!"

"Negative","aaawww batteries all charged up &amp; nowhere 2 go .."
"Positive","good info.  I've used this method before and it works perfectly.  I have a VM configured with a RDM to a local SSD."
"Negative","D'aw~  I would give you ( a very bad, but I would try! ) back rub. If you get my shoulders/neck :3"
"Negative","It's the marketing definition of ""general availability"" - it's *ready* for it, but not *actually* it :)"
"Positive","Veeam Endpoint is free and also supports scheduling, however, it's not a native vmware snapshot based backup (mainly used for bare metel servers). I use it for customers who can't afford to pay for the full license and it works great! I've used it for doing P2V transitions."

"Negative","oh crap i missed the workstation part!   sorry there is no encryption in workstation"
"Negative","No, I would not have. Although Bernie is at least consistent in his message & doesn't pander, he doesn't get economics. He wants socialism"
"Positive","I've done it this way on 3 separate occasions, and has worked without an issue. If you can't get away with turning the VM off you may have to use a host as a transition avenue, as long as it can see both the networking and storage you'd just have to do a number of disconnect/reconnects between vCenter's to shepherd the VM's."
"Positive","We've been working on some Cisco studying so we can offer the same (already sell plenty of EMC and Cisco networking, but we haven't attained ""Datacenter"" qualification yet). Glad to hear you're having good luck with it!"
"Positive","This is not direct answer, but you should consider migration to vCenter Appliance usage instead. You can use well rounded Migration workflow for this.  *Remark*: I run consultancy service in this area, feel free to DM for private assistance."
"Positive","Sure thing. It's rather an expensive service to be perfectly honest, but great for large organizations where they can afford it plus that extra attention is a must."
"Positive","To add to this vCAC also gives you the ability to allocate and manage resources based on the requesting user's role,  department,  etc to limit for example how long a VM can live.  While you could create deployment and destruction workflows in vCO, doing so would be cumbersome and not worth the time.   Orchestrator also has a lot of plugins to automate external infrastructure like Infoblox or Cisco UCS whereas plugins for vCAC are limited or being moved to Orchestrator.  Using Orchestrator can bring immediate value in automation and the workflows can be integrated with vCAC when self service is desired."
"Negative","I take it ESXi is unable to clean up after itself and/or clear partition from a disk by itself. Incredibly stupid."
"Positive","Softball game tonight cancelled...  To many stores have RZ events. Mark that up as another &quot;W&quot; for us!"
"Positive","Good call. OP needs professional help."
"Positive","I'm running the latest version 6.7 and have been for about 4 months.  It's been rock solid.  No issues at all.  Yes - it will work with 6.0 (any version) but nothing that's 5.x.  HTML5 is the future.  The Flex (Flash) client is being phased out.  I like 6.7 because the HTML5 client is pretty much full featured in it.  I haven't found anything I need to go back to the Flex client for yet."

"Negative","This guy is correct.  If you truly received a quote from Dell where they doubled the price of RAM and said it was due to Nutanix, you should take it up with your Nutanix rep - I'd suspect they didn't even know about this quote."
"Negative","jobless sux..  my daughters good-been sick on &amp; off a couple wks...ive been lucky-only got a touch of it..seems every1s sik"
"Positive","get a trial of something like VEEAM. It will allow you to replicate live VMs (if you so wish) out to OVA so you can port things around to HyperV or the cloud."

"Positive","Cloudmech, which Fling are you looking for? I might be able to help."
"Negative","You can do it per portgroup, just like you can set teaming settings per portgroup.   I've had to use it once with a client, where the switch didn't detect that the port failed and esxi kept sending data through the dead port."

"Negative","Some people need to seriously get a hobby.  Sorry @trent_reznor, because of a certain person, all bets are off.  I tried."
"Positive","Well, it IS an old processor generation. And it's quite possible that W2016 is more optimized to run on a newer processor."
"Negative","Do you have the NICs for the VMs set to VMXNET? That's best practice--we had issues with some of our servers when they were left on the default E1000e adapter."
"Negative","I actually called into vmware and the support guy said only the latest version would be offered. I saw a drop down on the download page that said I was not authorized and would need to register for a trial but, when I dot the the actual download page for the trial, there was no drop down asking for a version."
"Negative","Ik, but I was hoping she'd say its just a rumer"
"Positive","This was it. I first tried doing it under the advanced settings, and I noticed later that my changes were missing. I went back to the regular Settings panel and changed it there. Glorious 4k!"

"Positive","Thanks for the clarification - I had thought you could 'demo' on the test track and sit the actual exam @ VMworld!!"
"Positive","haha i couldn't, my dad is watching tv"
"Positive","I can't speak on running bundled vNICs, however, in ESXi 5.0 and 5.5 we've been experiencing a bug where portgroups that are set to trunk mode will randomly stop passing any traffic. From within the VM it appears as if the NIC is still up and everything is normal, but no packets will go through (I've only noticed it on CentOS, but none of our Windows VMs have any trunk NICs.) Restarting network service generally gets traffic flowing again. it would be interesting to experiment with bundled NICs to see if they both go down at once or not."
"Negative","Sounds about like what we get with dell. The worst part is not being able to open a ticket with nutanix directly. Have to go through dell."

"Positive","I had heard rumors of high end UCS Blade configs not being able to be fully powered in a UCS Chassis  I've been running 30 fully populated chassis for almost 7 years now, and have NEVER had this problem - one of my chassis has B200 M5s running \\~150 VMs each. I think that's fake news, or a customer not willing to admit that they haven't done enough work to supply the chassis with enough distinct feeds."
"Negative","current iOS app + iPhone 6 + iOS 11.x is awful.  Very slow to respond. Sometimes just hangs up. Must restart the app a bunch of times. Pls optimize for ""older"" phones.  (And yes, 11.x itself sucks on a 6)"

"Positive","Yeah, I know, just for me EMC == Storage."
"Negative","Apparently I have a virus, so the doctor's ordered me to stay home and rest until Thursday."
"Negative","Its such a nice day beside the fact that its like 100 degrees outside and we're moving. I wish I could go to the beach instead"
"Positive","There a reason you're stopping at 5.1?  I'd seriously look at 5.5 if at all possible; SSO introduced in 5.1 (if using vCenter) was buggy as heck; 5.5 made serious improvements.  (I haven't worked with Essentials, only Free standalone hosts and Enterprise/Plus with vCenter Standard)"
"Positive","Thank you. It's well done. You are the 4th person to tell me."
"Positive","Mellanox SX1024 might be of interest to you (48Port 10GbE + 12 40GbE/56GbE ports). For us we only need the SX1016 (64 port 10GbE) but the price p/port was unbeatable and delivered in our requirements for performance with our EMC arrays.   [Interesting report on Mellanox and buffers](http://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/mellanox)"

"Positive","Download the VMware Corporate Story and share with customers today -  ""One Cloud, Any Application, Any Device.""  http://vmw.re/1CKZdHK"
"Positive","Worth mentioning here that VeeamFree can be scheduled using PowerShell (they're own blog has a sample script on how to use it), but you are correct that there is no incremental support (and apparently no application aware guest processing)"
"Negative","I architected the Horizon View VDI environment for one of Dell Services largest customers. They had Unidesk, and I migrated all 500+ users off to Horizon with App Vols. Unidesk is great in theory, but it didn't work in prod for us. I was manually reBIC'ing the same desktops daily. Having to manually extract data from corrupt VDI daily. Opened numerous support cases and only got 1-off fixes and promises for better performance in the next versions. It never came, so we left."
"Positive","I did that (had to realize i need to enable vmotion on the NIC first): manual vmotion works without any issues, HA test infact also. After the warning is shown i need to wait another 30 seconds and then the VM is up. I guess i was just thinking this whole HA thing would happen in a small time span. Telling your customers this might take 5 minutes is toally normal from your experience right? Thanks btw.!"
"Positive","Can confirm this works. I just got a license key from VMUG to upgrade VSphere 6.x to Enterprise edition with Operations Management, until 31/08/2020  It's only valid for home lab setups, not production, but its still an awesome deal"
"Negative","Interesting, I will give that a try.  EDIT: After deleting all of the snapshots for the VM the issue persists."
"Positive","This is very very very easy with Veeam Free editon, I will post a link in a bit when I find it"
"Positive","So, I just decided to try again, but this time I chose one specific host in the destination cluster instead of the cluster itself (and also chose normal vMotion instead of high priority) and it's going over like it should now. Weird."
"Negative","Regarding virtual appliance, the information that the file krb5.conf is located at /etc is given too late. So at the first glznce on the page, the reader has a wrong impression that  the file has to be in /usr/java/jre-vmware/lib/security/ .\nPlease modify the contents accordinly to what is REALLY on the appliance"
"Negative"," I spent a good 3 days fiddling with it before I just gave up and rebuilt it  I'm a day and a half in and decided to ask here before moving forward with anything. On our environment it's not much of an inconvenience to delete all associations and rebuild.  We do have an active SnS agreement with vmware across all sites, but their support often isn't very helpful with these kind of things."
"Positive","Good thought, but cert is good through 2020."
"Positive","You can create a new vcenter server and point your system DSN to the existing database.  That will work like a champ."
"Negative","Susan Boyle should have won the BGT  her voice is AMAZING...but i guess for some people this is not enough"
"Positive","Well I do not have the money for the DVC track, if it still requires a 3k course.  Thanks for the information provided."
"Positive","I tested it on vCenter 5.5 U3e and it's working correctly."
"Positive","In our environment we actually manage replication of VDP in a few ways. We have straight VDP to VDP replication, but also have VDP to Avamar, and VDP to DataDomain which replicates to an offsite DataDomain appliance.  I think hands down it's a great product. I just wish the management console was a bit better. It's not as simple as something like the Avamar console to dig into a particular job and workout why it failed etc."
"Negative","due to train problems was almost late for his exam. Exam went alright. Got to go home and revise for the next one now"
"Negative","I just hope tomorrow race isnt like that"
"Positive","I wish there was a 7 Eleven!! I need some Vitamin C and echinacea.  where is a good man when u need one lol."
"Positive","Yep - in the process of doing that now, thanks."
"Positive","BTW: the Essentials package for $500 will cover cold migrations."
"Positive","Generally, the course is much more than 1500. Like 3-4k if you go through one of the big cert partners. Though, the course can be had for a few hundred bucks through one of the online Community Colleges (Such as Stanly CC). But you won't get the v6 class from them. They're doing 5.5 right now.  Also, you can sit the exam whenever you want. No need to take during / right after the class, unless you're ready. Though, some of the classes give a discount voucher that expires. Sometimes after a year or so."
"Positive","I thought i got a respond and my heart droped a lot and i got excited but then i realized it wasn't me...  sdhnashdnas! ha"
"Positive","Indeed :)  Even then, he only said about as much as you said.   From what I've been hearing (what little that is) I'd like to believe that VMware has something shiny in the works. I'll keep my eyes open for it.    As for the empty platitudes.... Every VMware employee I have dealt with has been great. I'll leave it at that."
"Negative","sorry bout heldin u up so long!"
"Positive","I mean I use 6.5 on my 710. No issues. I just use VMwares image and not the Dell customized iso. No issues."
"Negative","Got about 3 hours sleep last night  got up, had some water, lemsip, nurofen, and de-snorted my nose. Let's try this sleeping thing again."
"Negative","2+ hour delay for school. Really bad roads. They should have cancelled. #latestartforme"
"Negative","Watching all these episodes of 48 hours: Hard Evidence has made me incredibly paranoid in my everyday life.  I'm afraid to leave my house"
"Positive","I'll be damned, name checks out!"
"Positive","Run SPP on the servers to make sure you're up to date on firmware.  We have a bunch of Gen9s on Nimble Storage (mostly AF5000, but a few CS arrays) on both 6.0 and 6.5 and haven't had any issues with them at all.  They've been rock solid.  My Dell R730s on the other hand..."
"Positive","Thank you very much for the feedback and help ..  Iaindings, you are right, the real issue is I am unable to upgrade to Vista, I've copyed the XP VM  to a new custom VM  (pointed that to a folder with a copy of my XP VMDK files.) Once I tried to upgrade this 'new' VM to Vista I got a error indicating the BIOS where too old."
"Positive","Instant support with Transparent business demand and also Employee satisfaction"
"Negative","We more details for customizing vcloud director 9 login page."
"Negative","I don't mind expiry but the class requirement is a ridiculous money-grab.  An experienced sysadmin whose certification has expired does not need to go through ICM again."
"Positive","Learn what's new with #vSAN 6.5 in our 3-part webcast series 11/15-17 -- just 20mins each day:  http://bit.ly/2g8gEPj"
"Negative","This is what worries me about cloud only and Iaas services.   No one is around that keeps up with that bad month of patching and you then have down systems because of it.   I'm hoping Microsoft is now testing patching on aws and google but it's very possible they don't.  Same as how they should test on VMware, hyperv servers.  Maybe even xen like they would dell, hp or Lenovo."
"Positive","There are some PowerCLI scheduled tasks you can run to check if a pool is disabled. I originally started to muck about with it and crashed my connection server. That was the last I attempted to get any alerting. I've changed jobs since then and am no longer a View admin. (Was not fired for crashing the connection server. :D)"
"Positive","Net.NetPktSlabFreePercentThreshold - It's just a warning threshold. If it's set to 2 right now, raise it to 10 and you will be fine.  VSAN-iSCSI.ctlWorkerThreads - Who's telling you that this value should be -1? If the allowed range is between 0 and 4294967295, -1 can't be a valid option in vSphere 6.5. :D"
"Positive","I absolutely could, though it might help some customers who prefer to see something more ""official"" aka from KB. I'm still waiting to hear back, but if not, I'll publish it on my own Github/Blog to share as its already helped several large customers"
"Negative","kuch nahi im stressed out  i wanna cry"
"Negative","We have had our vSphere lab (only product testing and demonstration use) running on vSphere 6 since April and I have never seen this issue to occur on our ESXi hosts (4 x Cisco UCS C-Series rack servers).  I wouldn't upgrade production systems yet though, and this is what I am telling our customers also."
"Negative","Dunkin Donuts needs to start delivering! Im havin a fat moment but its raining outside"
"Positive","Stay hopeful, friends. RT @johnortberg Hope is the inseparable twin of fear."
"Positive","Thanks everyone, I'll give the utility a try"
"Positive","That's how i've done it before. But likely not an option here. I hate recoverpoint. Thank you though, is a reasonable idea generally."
"Positive","You should be able to move the drives from the 6i to the H710 and the new controller will pick up the configuration and you can import the virtual disk. This really isn't an ESXi question but a Dell RAID question. But anytime you are monkeying around with your storage like this, you should always have a backup. Always."
"Positive","@jasemccarty @AmericanAir Hahaha, following both makes for some great laughs and facepalms."
"Positive","Another new bottle arrived today, let's see if #babylam will take it. Stopped counting how many we have. Didn't know they made that so many!"
"Negative","About vSphere 7, they edited the release notes. Yesterday it was included. It seems VMware had a problem with it."
"Negative","Statement: Create a resource pool of the hosts in the management domain is not correct. Should read: Create a resource pool in the management domain (remove of the hosts) - Marek Zdrojewski"
"Positive","Oh ok cool, I could care less about configurations most of the time it's just to connect to something that's ""stuck"" or not working right. Thanks for the reply"
"Positive","Sounds like misconfigured SQL servers to me. Check memory settings in your SQL instance. Also check if the servers are using thick disks, thin disks can cause performance issues.   And get rid of the resource pools or configure them correctly."
"Negative","The cynic in me suspects that is exactly the reason they don't list them. It really rubs me the wrong way when I see VMware employees claiming the HTML5 client supports up to 90% of ""general workflows"". Sure it does, if you don't count the majority of the things it does not support against that metric :D"
"Negative","The EPUB version is broken, any chance we can get a republish?  When loading the epub it looks like it gets detected as a broken format .docx file."
"Positive","Agreed. Makes more sense to do that."
"Positive","Q6: In one sentence, share your experience with VMware Virtual SAN. Be creative! #vsanchat  http://www.via-cc.at/53b3k"

"Negative","I am using vmware workstation 10. I use physicla lan and vmxnet3. All the distros are updated. I try a fresh vm with another os (fedora) and I get the same issue"
"Positive","Even if GPU passthrough is working, there's too much overhead and bottleneck from the hypervisor to the guest OS.  I have tons of Nvidia Tesla cards here at work, these things will blow away any of your home built virtual machines.  Nvidia has a special driver that allows much better GPU passthrough.  I think with the amount of Tesla cards here, I can easily host a game streaming service here but they are being used for machine learning and AI."
"Positive","tell me it's 7.5.1! I will dig into it, thanks!"
"Positive","Thank you, that worked, i totally forgot that i had increased the allocated memory to 4GB, it works perfectly now :-) Is there any way that i can let it use 4GBs of my RAM without running into this issue?"
"Positive","Thanks guys, yes, I've had trouble in the past, but cannot remember the exact circumstance. That article unfortunately is clear as mud or maybe it's just me. :) I believe ERSPAN works across hosts so if you select a source port/vm on host1, host2 and host3 using ERSPAN, it will mirror all of them to the destination. However, I don't think the other methods behave that way. Finding a definitive answer on this topic is really tough."
"Negative","still at work.....gonna be late for birthday dinner"
"Negative","Too hot to sleep last night, dragging this morning.  Hello Monday.  Blech."
"Positive","Congrats on the new charter Heath!"
"Negative","No grace period.    I failed my retest, ws in a similar position. It is a major pain in the ass getting it back. Have to take the class over, take the foundation exam, then the VCP exam.  Can't take the exam until after the class or the class doesn't count."
"Positive","We featured @joshnesbit at our most recent #VMware all hands: ""Medic Mobile Improves Healthcare Using Mobile Tech"" http://ow.ly/4nnYDe"
"Positive","Oh yea.. Would love to find a cheaper solution to heat out there for the 3-4 months I'd need to."
"Negative","Maybe 5-8 times. no luck.  Honestly can't beleive I have to restore this many."
"Negative","no actual pricing on vCenter licenses"
"Positive","If you are trying to use flash in browser, you might want more a client based hypervisor, like horizon...using vm's as clients can be problematic if you expect the cpu to act as a gpu and then still be able to rdp all that you your screen far away.  ESXi is definitely a good upgrade from workstation pro, but depending on what you want to do as the endgame you might still need other things...  Remember this, chances are your server doesn't have a graphics card...and chances are you are not virtualizing the gpu (if you had one installed) and presenting it to your thin client either..."
"Positive","You might check out the Invicta UCS bundles too if you have any need for some sweet ssd storage. They're actually a surprisingly good deal with four blades, UCS interconnects, chassis and Invicta storage system."
"Positive","I'm almost certainly out of my depth here but path issues was my first thought as well FWIW."
"Negative","Scooter broke  It was four years old, it was time. @caseyzero has control of it now, is turning into mad science. Be afraid."

"Positive","No change at our physical or virtual layer.  We were discussing doing a ucs manager update due to the NTP bug for the version we're running now on the FI's.

"Positive","I'll have to put this is the lessons to be learned category."
