"Positive","I tried that and it didnt work. :( But I figured it out! I ran...      ethtool -i vmnic5       driver: ixgbe       version: 4.4.1-iov       firmware-version: 0x80000430  I saw ""version: 4.4.1-iov"", realized it was attempting to use SR-IOV with the pci channel. Rebooted, sure enough, that was disabled in the BIOS. Turned it on and we are golden!"

"Positive","Well, now that there is a March 2018 30% off coupon for upgrade to 14 Pro from 12 I think I'm going to upgrade our two workstation licenses.  I've had to recently upgrade the vmtool in our 12.5.9 workstation Windows guest VMs from 10.1 to 10.2 because shared folders between host and guests quit working after recent windows update.   and 10.2 was supposedly only certified for 14 Pro and not 12 Pro.  Yet it still worked in 12 Pro aand got us by the folder share problem.  But now with the discount I'm going to jump on the 14 Pro wagon."

"Positive","Support just confirmed that patch is not in 6.7U1, but is expected to be in U2."
"Positive","I really have to advocate for you not going through with that plan. That is not a great idea, even when perfectly executed. Can you not leave it internal, and get a jump box or something to get in and access it? Then you can set external firewall rules up to access the servers that you need on it."
"Negative","'In the desktop and application selection window"".  What the heck is that and how do I find it?"
"Positive","yeah I might just open a ticket with Cisco to be safe too.."
"Positive","Yep, once you've got the ESXi host up and running you can connect to it through the vSphere Client.  vCenter Server in my experience is used when you have multiple ESXi hosts you want to configure from one place, it lets you join them all and manage them at once (Through the vSphere Client)"

"Positive","Last time I looked at it workspace one it was a portal hat can be accessed and looked and felt the same on devices whether they be mobile or desktop. It would facilitate single sign-on for any html5-based site as well as apps and desktops published to the portal."
"Positive","It might be finicky depending on what zero clients you're using, but Horizon redirects some information about the physical/remote machine into the VM.  Check the following:  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Volatile Environment\\ViewClient_Machine_Name  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Volatile Environment\\ViewClient_IP_Address  If memory serves, there's more in that location if you need it as well.  You can make custom fields in BGinfo to pull that info and put it in your BGinfo."

"Negative","They accepted an employee that doesn't know their job description?  Explains shitty support there now."
"Positive","I'd say get them a copy of workstation and get familiar with VMs and virtualization on their local workstations. Then have them do some installs in a lab or on some older hardware. Get familiar with WEB UI, HTML, GUI maybe, and the concepts of shared storage between hosts and networking. Then I would hit HOL material."

I failed on the Design with some prep :-)  So if you're good on the ops side with some/major experience and perhaps working with a VAR or a big env you should be good to go.

I plan to stay with my employer until I retire at this point, and my boss could give two shits if I have the cert or not as I've proven that I know what I'm doing."
"Negative","I don't like to play with FWs either.  Guess I'll wait for HCL update. Hope it won't take long.  Btw 15.00.01.00 does not have ""All Flash"" in features. I have not noticed it before. Does it meen all flash is not supported on 15?"

"Negative","Given your experience it seems like you wouldn't be qualified for the job but it's pretty hard to say given the information provided. If that's the entire job posting then you'll probably need additional information."
"Positive","Well, that's one way to do it but this (albeit pointless) requirement doesn't necessitate any sort of remote delivery. You could do it locally using ESXi and nothing else, apart from equal parts patience and desire to spend your time doing something pointless. For someone who's not very familiar with esxi already, it's never going to happen.  FWIW, the VADC plugin works with vDGA so you don't need a view server or vcenter server to do it, just a single win7 VM. Oh and tera1 is absolutely adequate too, with the dual screen limitation of vdga and vSGA, there's no performance difference. Most improvements with t2 are around hardware pcoip and new features/security."

Plex transcoding for remote users, if your library has x264 Hi10 or x265 media in it then you do need it, It's why I switched from a C2750 to a Ryzen 1700. That and PCIe pass-through."

"Positive","I prefer XenServer. Hyper-V can be more pain than it is worth. I had a client try to get their Hyper-V hosts working in a cluster. I don't directly support Hyper-V but our product can run on top of it along with other hypervisors so I tried to help him out. I ended up having to send him to Microsoft support who worked with him for about a week. They couldn't figure out how to get the cluster working either. Honestly his problem was he was trying to reuse some existing hosts without reinstalling Windows so I think someone before him really jacked up the installs and he didn't want to rebuild them. Still the more I touch Hyper-V the less I like it."
"Positive","As you have just one host, why do you want a huge datastore? Just give create a datastore to each VM and done! Ie: Create a FileServer VM and give it like 5TB and create a share to your users. Keep it simple."
"Positive","Pretty sure I had a similar issue last year. It's a bug in the Netscaler version. You need to upgrade. I'm not at work at the moment so can't find the details. If you still need help in about 14 hours let me know. I'll look up what I did."
"Positive","she's not ugly!! She's gorgeous  ... She's my baby! Lol"
"Positive","Remote Desktop isn't nearly as hard on the systems as doing full blown VDI, currently the RD farm is running on just a few normal hosts served storage via iSCSI. The users generally don't need to run very heavy apps at all so hard drive speed isn't a huge issue for us. The SAN is set up in RAID10 with a fair quantity of disks and it seems to be doing a good job of keeping up with our needs as it stands.  In a farm of 2-4 RD servers the need to go to templates isn't that crucial either, it would be more elegant that way but it's also not  crucial, as it would be for a full blown VDI setup where you're looking at dozens of virtual machines.  So literally just switching protocols to get a more responsive remote experience is what I'd like to see.  The whole thing is a holdover from an earlier install, just translated to a virtualized envionment, so we're still rocking the ""good old"" roaming profiles and group policy, that too probably does need to be looked at.   So right now I'm just trying to get a better grasp of how you go from a bog-standard vSphere setup with a SAN backend to having Horizon Advanced on there and serving RDHS via PCoIP."

"Positive","Veeam's preferred architecture is to have 3-7 restore points on disk - SAN ideally over NAS and then keep long-term retention in a tape or other WORM/airgap type of protocol.   This gives you fast restores and the ability to spin up a VM on the disk target,  but without a single protocol that can be infected with malware.     Virtual tape is a great resource for the second part - provides the speed of disk but the security of tape.   Some other options include cloud-based object storage."

"Positive","I'm glad someone else thinks these things through.  :-)  Most of the advice I got when investigating was to reconfigure my NFS server to ignore the sync flag to ""speed things up.""  I figure that my server shouldn't second-guess client requests centering around data integrity.  With that said, it was pretty clear by viewing packet traces that ESXi 5.1 as an NFS client was making some pretty poor choices.  EVERY write does not need to be a synchronous write...  The ""magic"" is that ESXi does not request every iSCSI write to be synchronous-- only important ones (e.g. metadata updates.)  It could use the same logic on NFS... but it doesn't.  The storage still fully honors sync flags when requested, because I wasn't about to disable a key data integrity feature.  I'm funny like that.  :-)"

I started like this due to the fact that we had incorrect or outdated information which I could not ignore due to the political stature of the outgoing admin with the still-current bossy man.   This despite my wanting to use them in the first place.   However, I'm thinking that this means I need to have a 10GB backbone plus the isolated iSCI I already have. Right now, I don't really have this, but I DID just get a 10GB switch just for doing vMotion, so I might be able to convert that for use into my core switches.   It's a bit messy in one rack due to all the excess cabling and the weird approaches to cabling up to now.

"Positive","I wouldn't worry about failing storage shelves. The only time this is a consideration is in super high availability systems; in such designs, you will see the designer deploying patterns such as: purchase 8 entire shelves, and then create your RAID sets out of one drive from each shelf. But these sorts of designs are the kind that most folks never see in their careers. They are typically only used for systems where either lives or lots and lots of money are on the line."

"Negative","I just went through a Horizon View setup. The base configuration (Connection Server, Composer, Golden Images, etc...) was super easy. Getting all of the onesy-twosy hardware devices working properly using thin clients was the PITA.  Just found out that our EMV card readers won't work with thin clients because they present as COM ports and the Linux View Client doesn't redirect COM ports, only Windows supports COM redirection."
"Positive","Have a Bud Lite Lime, that will top it off. AND you could have shared instead of eating it ALL  LOL"

"Positive","Your Augmentix A+1950 appears to be nothing more than a Dell PowerEdge 1950 thats been ruggedized.  So when looking for How To docs and such, you can safely substitute the two.  The PE1950 was based on the Xeon 5000 and 5100 families of processors."
"Negative","Eating breakfast. I've attempted to do my make-up nice today but it won't stay on for long because of this bloody weather..."
