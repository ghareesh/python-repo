0,it's not like I haven't been talking about it for 6-8 years on my own blog.
1,"With a modern data center, you can cut costs and improve #security. Join us in Houston tomorrow to learn more. http://bit.ly/2tH4MXR"
2,"In today's storage landscape, there is a myriad of choices! Find out why #VMware managed storage is your answer:  http://bit.ly/2VuMzKn"
3,"I hoped that it could be done via GUI.  I didn't even know about PowerCLI, but I'll try it [I'm a total newb, so not sure if I'll succeed].  I just can't understand why such an obviously demanded feature is not in the box...  Thanks for your help."
4,math final tomorrow...im getting an ulcer over it
5,Huh... I wasn't expecting that to show up on Twitter.. Time to fix that. :(
6,With the labs available online now I took the approach of not doing any at vm world and use that time for more sessions last year.
7,"My findings were mismatched MTU settings on the switch or storage.  I didn't have the time to figure out the exact culprit (and those parts aren't my responsibility), but scaling down to 1500 resolved all issues immediately.  I would only suggest using jumbo frames on dedicated iSCSI networks with properly configure vmnics/vSwitch/portgroup/vmkernel."
8,for some reason I don't get them either
9,Is hungry....wants good food...I want my mother back to feed me
10,Happy (late) Memorial Day from my family to yours!
11,A doctor who graduates at the bottom of his class is still a doctor...  Good job man!  Crack a cold one and chill!
12,Someone threw my keys away in the trash  had to dig thru it to find it ... Bad times [
13,"They are flashed with WDidle, and spindown is disabled. I'm not sure about the WD ESXi is running from tough. Thanks for the insight, I will look into that! Would that explain the reboot problem tough? I guess they spin up on power-on? I guess it is time to change it anyway :)"
14,"This response seems way more valid, you know this, lol. I see your point; that's also why I wondered if the ~$270 was worth it, being that I'll have the board maxed out on memory either way. I'm pretty sure I'm going with the 3900x, it just seems to be the better choice."
15,"My wife has this same issue with running games in VMWare Fusion on Windows  7.  She to has a Macbook Pro with Intel GPU.  I had her bootcamp instead and her issues went away.  Also, old mechanical 5400 RPM drives tend to run poorly after a few years of service on Macbook Pro's.  You could ask your IT Department for an SSD if you already do not have one."
16,You have devolved into pedantry and fallacies to support an incoherent and dumb point of view that is so plainly wrong that it hurts me to think there are people who are this obtuse.
17,"The VMware answer is **NOT** to delete the VM or delete the hard disk. Simply booting off of the ISO, formatting the disk, and re-installing the OS is the proper way to go about doing this.   Edit: Unless it's a different OS entirely, then yes, kill the VM and recreate it. We use predefined virtual hardware settings when you select your OS for best performance."
18,"Agreed since relationships are important and moving around can effect credibility.  However, as technology changes, one must represent the best technology, so there will always be some level of moving around."
19,Just had a chargilled chicken sandwich from chick fila tryna do the right thing - Sooo not good!!
20,Q: How do you monitor a database consistently and reliably? \nA: @WavefrontHQ \n\nLearn more here: http://bit.ly/2BcjnN1
21," Nexenta: good performance  All thanks to ZFS! Having their HA up and running' is cumbersome, though."
22,"Yeah, i was hoping to get the free one. (Hahaha!) Not yet out"
23,"eff this nausea business. just gonna hang 2nite n watch movies with my dad,craig,&amp;peanut. love just layin around. boo bout my foot  ouch!"
24,"This is the right answer, although not extremely helpful right now.  The future you will thank you though.   When you change the template, update the number.  You will be so happy when this is actually needed and you can quickly and easily identify all VMs built from a specific template and version."
25,"Unfortunately this is a very locked down environment and we have no way of remoting into the host. Its all blocked. But I am on the DC and looking at the logs, which dont seem to be helpful to me :("
26,hoping that sleeping will take away the pain in my ladies...
27, the documentation needs work  Understatement of the year.  In some places it looks like a collection of development notes.
28,"Explain how it takes 12 hours to do 0% of the clean-up, then the cancel button also doesn't work."
29,"Agree with you there, @the_eggwhite. My hayfever is bad today. Not using prescription stuff but 1 pill &amp; spray's have not banished pollen"
30,@g_mulholland @tomralph A little harsh don't you think?
31,minimal procedural burden but maximal service quality
32,"I arrived here via Google and cannot tell what product this is for, or where I am in the mass of the aware documentation hierarchy. There should be a bread crumb or some sort of path or other indicator about where I am, and what product this feature actually applies to."
33,just got home. work tomorrow. i know &quot;work is a four letter word&quot;. no pool fiesta for moi  bummer.
34, we are currently on a change freeze   That sounds amazing.
35,That's a remarkably small amount. You're a unicorn.
36,"Well, when you're on a tight budget..."
37,I just woke up from the worst nap ever and to top itoff I'm hungrier than I've been in a long while *shakes head* fml
38,We're running the latest 5.5U3b (Build: 3248547) so this should not be the issue.
39,FTT=2 is for 6-9s - you get between 4-9s to 5-9s for FTT=1\nCost efficiency is going to improve soon ;)
40,Think @PembsDave must have blocked me as not heard a Tweet from him for a while
41,"Hello,   It is the same for me ! It is totally bad from VMWare.... I'm waiting for this update but 0 effect... The issue still here... On the concerned vCenter ""**A**"" : We are up to date on all our ESXi(s) :  VMware ESXi, 6.7.0, 14320388  / Cluster and the vCenter  6.7.0 - 14792544 .  But as like you, we didn't have the problem on another vCenter ""**B**"" (Horizon environment only used with vSAN). On this vCenter we didn't performed the update because all is good... We are in  6.7.0 - 13639324 for the vCenter and for the ESXi, 6.7.0, 13981272.  The difference between vCenter A and B is that on the vCenter A (where we have the issue) we have 4 vSAN Clusters and 10 FC/Classic Clusters. Maybe the issue can from this mix ? I think before that the issue from that fact we started from 5.5 or 6.0 (i don't remember) but now, i don't think that it was the only problem...   Someone have already open a case on VMWare ?"
42,hayy gurll i know i would always kick your ass but thats not the pointt  i miss you bb its scorching hot here
43,no clear steps to migrate or upgrade existing Vcenter and SSO where these roles are on separate servers and seems we ended up with just do a trail upgrading existing Vcenter and SSO to single PSC/VC to 6.5 version
44,"Catching up with work on my day off... dedicted or stupid? Either way, I'm really missing the Friday morning cakes"
45,"hostd.log will have the event, it will look like  ""Remote access for ESXi local user account 'root' has been locked for 900 seconds after 45 failed login attempts."" ""Rejected password for user root from &lt;ip Address"""
46,"Thanks. I do have some View experience (although 1-2 years old at this point), and luckily I have another sandbox to play in before I go.  The end result is working with NVIDIA GRID, which should be fun."
47,It's not a vSphere view or a CLI tool but check out RVTools at http://www.robware.net/  It should give you all of the information you are looking for and then some. PowerCLI can certainly do it as well but RVTools makes it super easy.
48,"Awesome work @Virtual_Simon, but I just want to re-iterate that the licensing changes does NOT affect #VMWonAWS as I see you ran this against a VMC setup."
49,Community storage & availability code samples now on StorageHub! Get the details: http://bit.ly/2J89eYT
50,"New #VMware #Horizon (with View): Install, Configure, Manage v6 course now available via classroom & live online.  http://bit.ly/Xi3Tng"
51,"Doing it by name can cause a lot of problems.  In our environment, we have an isolated set of clusters with each ESXi host having 2 IP address.  One for SSHing and remote consoles, and one that the vCenter server talks to it over.  So we stand up the vCenter server, then put in a host file entry for each of the hosts by the DNS name that we are using.  The host file uses the IPs of the isolated network.    Then we set up the ESXi host, set up the other VMK interface, and give it the IP address of the ""management"" network, and we're done.  Our PCs use a DNS server that resolves the management network's IPs, and the vCenter uses a host file to get a different IP."
52,probably.  I hate handwashing. I hate washing in general
53,I wish you guys would get things solved with Travelport ASAP. I book a lot of corp travel w/you. Now it's more difficult :(
54,wonders how some people can treat  the elderly as if they're dumb. I wish I could be with my Nan right now.

58,410/500 but I'm done trying to keep it current.  Not worth the effort to have to dive deep in the weeds every couple of years.
59,"If I install esxi to an SD card or flash drive, could I boot off of that and see if it still crashes? That would at least tell me if the VMs are crashing the host or if its ESXi right?"
60,@jtroyer I wish I could have made it!

67,I've done some digging but it's unclear and I can find nothing that says if I should upgrade vCenter first and then move servers and or move servers first and then upgrade.   I didn't realize that one could P2V to a ESXi host rather than vCenter itself. I'll look into that! Thank you! Have you ever tried to P2V a vCenter?
68,It's going to be very cold in the caravan in the driveway. :)

70,"Yes,  I use PernixData FVP with local SSD to accelerate many of our VMware workloads.  There's a free trial available if you want to try and the latest release will also use RAM for acceleration so you don't even need to add SSD if you just want to try it."

74,did that...have to go apply for a new card now.
75,"I feel I need to clarify something important:  I work with firm windows, and can take down pods when I do this.  I do the above in a single window, and often will run several installs in tandem.  My big priority is getting everything done in one window, and the ESXi upgrades eat time, so I like to get those going as early in the process as possible- thus the early vSphere upgrade.  HOWEVER...  You are running 7.4, and is isn't supported on 6.7U2.    You should probably upgrade the Composer / Connection server first in case you have an issue or run long on your upgrade."

104,"If you are doing the free hypervisor, I  struggle to understand why you would use VMware over Hyper-V. I understand that this is the VMware subreddit and that this may not be business related, but the free version of ESXi is missing a lot of crucial features that you would get with Hyper-V (Backup API's being the big one)."
105,"Strict co-scheduling is, when all vCPUs if a VM can be scheduled on the physical CPU cores.   With Relaxed co-scheduling, vCPUs of VMs can be scheduled independently e.g. when not all vCPUs are used. This creates a cpu skew. If the skew is too big, the vCPUs that have been run more often, have to wait for the other vCPUs to keep up. When the application inside the VM expects all vCPUs to be scheduled in parallel, this can again lead to performance loss. It was introduced in ESX 3.x and improved in 4.x.  It's all explained on vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive page 156. It's available for free and a great resource if you want to understand how ESXi works."

120,You could make load runner work. The problem is you might run it and get great results but still have poor user experiences due to other factors like network etc. Also something like View Planner can generate load.  I would suggest vRealize Ops for View and Lakeside Systrack.  Between the two of them you'll get all of the real time and historical data you need to gauge user experience and they aren't that expensive.

124,"I may have misunderstood, as I was talking about NSX for virtualised networking.  If you're talking more like VLANs and segregation on your switching hardware, then I think the biggest question is whether you're suffering bandwidth constraints on your current gigabit interfaces.  If not, sticking with your current interface set up, and building on that with greater segregation etc., may be a cheaper and more effective way to keep learning. I've only moved to 10Gb for VM storage connections in my lab, since running storage for multiple VMs over a single gigabit connection can get a bit restrictive."
125,"Thanks for the heads up. The last diagram in the supported deployment models list is what I'm hoping to achieve. However I appreciate with my current setup I run the risk of moving into the first ""depreciated"" model."

128,"Yep, not working like that.  You'll have to shutdown/freeze the VMs, put the host in maintenance, and patch the host manually via CLI.  I'm curious though, why a vCenter when you have only one host?"
129,Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately doing a disconnect/reconnect didnt resolve the issue. I'm hoping support has a resolution.

140,"I don't think anyone disputes that there are gains (even if they do dispute the amount) but we are just saying that it isn't worth the support headache and unpredictable reliability.  I also question the scale of some of these measurements.. I support 1100 hosts and every time some clever design engineer specs jumbo frames, it bites us later. To the point where we stopped approving them for operational handoff.   Edit: if you have a smaller, more controlled environment.. By all means, go for it... It just hasn't worked for us at scale. Maybe it is a process problem, or too much siloing, or not enough standardization, or who knows what else. Scale is hard."

144,"You might run into NUMA spanning issues with16 vCPU. Best to evaluate the actual needs of the VM as others have said.  Remember, though, that even if a guest OS doesn't use some of its vCPU allocation, vCPU assignment still imposes resource requirements on ESXi that translate to real CPU consumption on the host.   It can also depend on how busy your host is. The general concept floating out there of ""more CPU equals better performance"" has the consequence of CPU processing taking significantly longer on a busy server than if the VM in question only had a single CPU assigned."

166,I would imagine it would work but vm tools functionality might be off...  Since the post I tried the same on what I thought was an identical load and it worked... turns out I selected the wrong esxi iso and installed 6.7u2 instead of 6.7u3.  The 6.7u3 on the other system worked fine.  So I suspect the win10x64 128gb limit is specific to 6.7u2 and was fixed in 6.7u3.  I'll verify in a few hours.
167,Thanks Chuck that all makes sense to me. I will lower some of our Dev / Cert VMs and check performance impact.

178,"Avamar Virtual Edition is pretty good and the replacement for VDP. Also, permits for any physical nodes as well and customer installable."
179,I'm a bit confused on the licensing strategy.    I was told if you're running SQL as a VM the physical hardware doesn't matter from a licensing standpoint.  It's the number of virtual cores that you're allocating to the VM (with a minimum of 4 virtual cores).  You won't need to worry about CALs as they're included in the core-based license model.
180,"I think your idea of using the passmark as a template for sizing isn't too bad.  Obviously the passmark score stresses certain aspects of a CPU more than others (integer &amp; fp performance over cache and bandwidth), so the actual extent of the performance improvement will depend on your application.    Is there a way you can benchmark your VMs though?  Some kind of standard by which you measure their performance.  I'd try running a VM or 10 on one of each of the types of hardware with the same number of vCPUs per VM and see what kind of performance difference I see in the application itself."
181,I can't find anyone else I know who is on Twitter....I am so alone here
182,Agreed. Sounds like management are trying to point fingers rather than concentrating on the actual root cause.  Typical.
183,Size your shared storage for I/O not capacity - always.   You'll almost always run out of I/O before capacity on any production storage.
184,"And 10Gb is actually only a generic number in the driver.       With the right CPUs and Memory config, you can actually get more than 10Gbps between VMs on the same node."

191,@vBrianGraf @tenthirtyam I know it's going to be very popular..
192,Sure no worries.  `cd /etc/systemd/system`  `systemctl list-unit-files | grep masked`  This will show you the list of services which are masked. Then go thru the list copying the service name and run unmask cmd. E.g.  `systemctl unmask vmafdd.service`

194,Thanks. Is there any reason to have lots of storage on the hosts?  Say I get a NAS. Won't that be a single point of failure?

198,"Good to know about the configmax stuff. I'll check it out.    I hope to get some questions on VSAN. I have it turned up in my lab just to better understand it.   &amp;#x200B;  Getting VSAN turned up was a great project in and of itself. It was not turnkey one bit. I turned up a 2-node cluster with a witness.    List of issues...  1. my esx hosts did not recognize all my disks    1. Turned out that since I had used some of them in a ZFS array at one point, vmware was not able to deal with the partition tables on those disks. Had to dig into the esxcli and partedUtil to manually wipe the disks so my hosts would be able to use them for the VSAN cluster. 2. Once VSAN was turned up, I had a bunch of  health check errors.     1. first big one was my networking, although technically functioning, had best practice issues.        1. This caused a few redo's of the configs for the physical switch, the vSwitch, and the portgroups.        2. Converting it all over to a distributed switch is on the todo list.       3. For the record, my vm access networks are all on distributed switches specifically to understand distributed switches... 3. Then, when I was running into a number of other issues that I could not figure our for the life of me, I realized that the witness disks were an older disk format (6) than the cluster disks (7).     1. This led me down the path of figuring out that the witness appliance was an older version that the hosts in the vsan cluster.    2. Once I updated the witness appliance, 95% of my errors went away.  4. All I have remaining is a warning about my ""Time Sync"". Which is odd since the hosts and witness are synced dead on, but all three are nearly 2 minutes off from vCenter. yet they are all configured with the same NTP source.  5. A warning about my raid controller. not surprising, im using an old hp dl380 6. And a network config warning for not using a DVS"
