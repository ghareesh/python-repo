"Positive","You need something in the cloud, accessible to all those points, not copied / synced between them."
"Negative","a further note.. I'm not sure this is a DSW issue, but perhaps LACP (which I think requires DSW).  The first host worked fine, but when I add a new LAG to the dsw and assign the physical adapters on the second host to uplink ports from that new LAG then I get a timeout error in vcenter.  I also see the interfaces on my catalyst 3750 going up and down repeatedly.  The switch configs for both hosts are the same.. I mean, different port-channel interfaces, but the same beyond that."

"Negative","its not working. i just made my dad waste $19.90"
"Negative","Upgrading of hosts is too involved. It will be easier to re-install from a fresh ISO. The documentation around updates is hopeless."

"Positive","Did Apple announce new 32GB memory support & USB-C Mac Mini's yet? ;)"
"Positive","Alright, so this is going to be a little funky here, and there is a very good chance of fucking everything up...  If you have any space available, use something like gpartd and create two partitions.  Make one a few gigs in size and give the other partition the rest of the space.  Then install ESXi on to the host.  When selecting and install location, select the partition you created for ESXi.  It MAY show up.  And by may, I mean there is a snowball's chance in hell it does, but it depends on how the RAID controller presents storage to the OS (ESXi).  The indication is essentially a WWN address, followed by a colon and a number.  The number after that indicates the partition.  If you select that, the installer will ask you if you want to format the disk.  You tell it ""fuck no"" and be on your merry.  That should do it.    Aaaand sorry for the formatting.  I do not think I have had enough Jameson."

"Negative","It is a citrix VDI farm and I asked twice weekly from December 2015 to April 2017 to put the VMs in stand by or power off when the user logs out.  I was told that I don't understand the paradigm of developers waiting 4 seconds for a desktop to boot.  Then they ignored my warning about adding CPUs to VMs ""My VM is too slow, add RAM and CPU""    I can't patch.  I can't update firmware on UCS chassis.  I am starting to get snippy when they ask me what can be done, then being ignored.  We spent 500k on new HP servers that have been online since February 1st that just this week they starting standing new Citrix XA servers.  I spent 4 weeks working with networking begging them to stop using LACP on my uplinks.  Finally they caved and the flapping stopped.  I could go on, but this is not as cathartic as portrayed on television"

"Positive","That is a pretty good bet, I had to add a VIB to even get the NIC to be recognized. I have that many cores on it because I'm also running Plex on it, but that's secondary since I can outsource that into another VM. I will give Server 2016 a try, as long as I can get the storage pool to be recognized I'm good with alternative solutions :P  Thanks for the suggestions so far, I'm open for more input"

"Negative","for the lazy, article is from 2014: ""Virtustream anticipates it will be profitable by the end of this year""    So unless there is other public information, its not as of yet turned profitable. Gross revenue is not the same as Net revenue. If you sell beans for $100 million, and it costs you 100 million, it wont help your piggybank at the end of the day."
"Negative","I guess that didn't work for me... I set 2 NICs to pass through, but, it stays Enabled / NEED REBOOT. The problem is, I rebooted the host 6 times and it stays like that, NEEDS REBOOT...  Everything I tried it does not work...sigh"

"Positive","Thanks.  I applied the patch, but it seems it setting the value to 1 for LVM.EnableResignature didn't help.  I followed the steps in the link above that suggested doing it, but after applying the patch and going for reboot, rescanning for datastores didn't find the datastore and the VMs were all inaccessible.
