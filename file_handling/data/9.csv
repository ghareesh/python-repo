"Positive","I chuckled when I read that. :)"
"Positive","Dell Wyse 5070's have been great for us. They have ones that do PCoIP and RDP out of the box and then you can download a package and add Blast later if you like.  They are ThinOS and not managed by the crappy tera console either which is nice."
"Negative","Mornin everyone, kind of sad this morn my boobie got locked up"
"Negative","I'll just go watch Angels &amp; Demons tomorrow~ it's getting late and I won't catch the second to the last showing anymore."
"Negative","they aren't selling jamba juice at my school today  they're going to sell it next week. on monday."
"Negative","i know. miss you! me 'stoy muy triste"
"Positive","I'm low carb. I found plain chicken breasts one day in the hang space. And little bottles of hot sauce! It was a glorious feast, indeed!"
"Negative","geez. What possesses people to be such a-holes?"
"Positive","After reading this, and the other threats of RAID5 being a bad idea, I ended up ordering 3 more drives. Will have 6 total, and change them to RAID10. Won't need to expand for a while too.   Thanks for the help."
"Positive","Your favorite series is on-demand! Start your weekend with a vSAN  episode on vDS and network underlay with vSAN. http://bit.ly/2HAJ6CK"
"Positive","Yessir, and thank you!  In theory if all goes well, we will be running on a fresh VMWare environment, with proper admin authority (long story, but any changes I make in the current one has to be done on the host level, because we LITERALLY don't have an admin account for the vsphere login), and will have put this sad, sad display behind us.  :)"
"Negative","Console gives me a blank grey screen."
"Positive","Why does some #tech take off while some marinates for years before achieving success?  http://bit.ly/2fFJ7uI"
"Positive","A truly beautiful campus Tarun, we are very lucky!"
"Negative","Freaking annoying with the remote console. Yes VMware, I know, how about this goes away the first time, not each and every time I need console access. Grrrr...."
"Negative","I wonder if any of the folks who work on it were laid off recently..."
"Positive","Better option w/""Virtual Container Host"" which is vSphere RP Pool to provision Containers allows DRS to perform placement on hosts! #INF5229"
"Negative","Yeah, it follows his little sister...I am rather skeptical. No Jake Gyllenhaal."
"Positive","I'm not sure about the driver age, I would assume the Dell iso would have the newest. There is less work using the dell iso vs using stock and patching. Like /u/i_hate_sidney_crosby said, it also helps with Dell support issues."
"Negative","hey i am still home with Kaitlyn and i am meant 2 be doin by homework but i feel 2 sick2 do anything"
"Negative","Sorry, didnt read until the end :-) its probably an error in a vmdk. Had the same error a few weeks ago and ended up rebuilding the datastore"
"Positive","Why are you shutting the entire cluster down? Why not migrate it to a different spot host while it's host reboots?  And some form of idrac/Ilo/BMC is your friend in this situation otherwise."
"Negative","I'm sleepy  and my voice is hoarse"
"Positive","you can make VMDKs of your VM split into files, instead of one big file."
"Positive","Joined subreddit and twitter...  thank!"
"Positive","usually with VMware that is wise however in this case 6.5 is a rusty pile of garbage and 6.7 fixed it"
"Negative","i am unable to initiali log in with initial/default administrator"
"Positive","I have plenty of customers doing FTT=2. Especially in the All-Flash world with RAID-6 it makes sense. Cheaper than FTT=1/RAID-1 but with added redundancy, I strongly feel it should be the new standard!"
"Negative","Yes, I have tested it. Same problem. Besides, I also tried to install 6.7 on other PC with the same NIC passed through. The result is the same. Guess this is universal problem  on windows 10"
"Positive"," pNFS (which isn't really a real standard) has really little chance of adoption  vVols + iSER (NVMeoF) will kill pNFS for sure .."
"Negative","It sounds like something might be broken with both cards and possibly IDSDM if nothing is saving on the second card.  I'd update the firmware serve then log a ticket with Dell to replace both cards."
"Positive","No idea, but I don't hear about customers losing data or struggling to upgrade their Tintris or even languishing in support hell.  I'm not saying it's *bad*, just that from what I've read of it, I personally wouldn't trust it right now without some good lab/test time. The idea and (from what I've seen) execution of it, I love - just needs some more success stories out there to get over the failures I've read about. I suspect the main failing of it to be the hardware people give it, which I guess VMware can't do much about beyond having it check itself the hardware against the HCL and flagging it?"
"Positive","Time to pull a server offline ? vSAN 6.7 offers minimized maintenance disruptions! Experience all 6.7 has to offer.  http://bit.ly/2wynmUD"
"Negative","Missing my friend and I cant reach him on his mobile. sad"
"Positive","Oh? I'm sorry I didn't even realize there was a thing called Always-on, i'll look into it"
"Negative","NO database requirements information on the ""Database Requirements"" topic.  Need info on database sizing."
"Negative","Bed after a long talk with the bestie! Love her!!!!!!!! So tired though, boo waking up early and going to the dentist  I HATE the dentist!"
"Negative","Without knowing your budget nobody can start help you."
"Positive","Add to this: Block storage is robust and fantastic, if you have a product that's built for it. Synology is not that product.  Synology is a NAS. Use it as a NAS, and you'll be MUCH happier with it than if you use it as a SAN. Using it as a SAN is asking to have a nightmare.  If your management wanted iSCSI, they should have bought a proper iSCSI SAN (Compellent, 3PAR, EMC, Equallogic, Lefthand/storevirtual, etc). Given they bought a Synology, you should go with NFS."
"Negative","is so sadddd. ... docmike doesn't trust me"
"Negative","There is no option ""Display Scaling"" in Workstation 14 UI"
"Negative","It's embarrassing that I have to open something I'm IE for it to work right in 2017."
"Positive","Excellent! Dinner tomorrow? cc: @eck79"
"Positive","It's not particularly strange. Server hardware rarely has any emphasis placed on display output/GPU and is meant to just sit in a rack and be untouched while you manage it remotely. The only hyper visor I can think of that will let you do this Microsoft's Hyper-V on top of Windows Server and that may have changed since I last used it"
"Negative","I think the last time I did it I kept a spreadsheet with all that info for all of my hosts. I've got everything labeled so I can tell what stuff is. I think  ""Networking configuration  Host port group  vlan 2216 - iSCSI to Pure1  IP address settings  IPv4 address"" is pretty descriptive. It's annoying that I have to mouse over it to see the full thing, but it works. Of course this is 6.5Ucurrent using the HTML5 client. I remember it being more annoying in 6.0, but still not too bad. I really wish they'd just present it as a spreadsheet."
"Negative","Ports are TCP or UDP? (TCP, I know, but not the same for everyone who need the documentation...)\nDefault port for SSL/TLS (5671) not listed.\nThe usual half baked documentation."
"Negative","i am a domain admin, sorry, should have mentioned that!"
"Positive","Since most people don't reserve resources at the VM level _(versus resource pools, which don't count in the Admission Control calculations)_, most Admission Control efforts seem useless.  When I had larger clusters I would set percentage-based values calculated from cluster size. But it was important to explain to people that this didn't ensure/guarantee N+1 or have much impact."
"Positive","the log to look at is mentioned in the blog post :)"
"Positive","Commercial lenovos or HPs will work. I sell dozens of these a year for designers and other power users. i7, 16gb ram, SSD and you're good to go. Just don't buy that consumer garbage"
"Positive","We always set ours to High Performance mode. We always found the power saving feature too sluggish really and found the impact on virtual machines too noticeable."
"Negative","According to Chapters web site - August 25th. I know, too long. Sorry to be the bearer or bad news"
"Positive","I do realize that an SSD is a great upgrade; however, I am more concerned whether this upgrade will affect OS X El Capitan's performance inside vmware workstation, as in, will it run more smoothly?"
"Positive","Good morning twitter! Up early again due to our car alarm going off at 5am, then again at 7am. Poxy foxes keep jumping on the bonnet!"
"Negative","great! now the electricity is out!"
"Negative","your documentation is SHIT, all i want to do is change the management IP Address, try searching for how to do it."
"Positive","I have also a files server at 2TB he's got his own backup job.  It's easier to copy backup data offsite when backup are small."
"Positive","Not only that, but it will give them a nice little sandbox for dev after this run."
"Positive","You might try using VLANs instead, if your switch is capable."
"Positive","Equallogics are good. They are middle of the pack on features, middle of the pack on architecture.   Good. Not great. But good enough."
"Negative","Yeah, but he cheated so it's not really worth gold."
"Positive","Not really free. But I like Sophos (enterprise) and how it integrates with their firewalls."
"Positive","Thrilled to announce #VMware Site Recovery Manager 8.2! Dive into the possibilities. http://bit.ly/2KABUL5"
"Positive","Okay #vCommunity, let's take this a step further. Reply with pics of your #homelab setup . We'll be retweeting the best throughout the weekend!"
"Positive","I've actually discussed the fish tank attack. See my other reply here were I talk about isolating your management interfaces and adopting a least privilege model. IoT is a clear and present danger to any datacenter. Never, ever discount the ability of the human condition to make your life a living hell. It's EASY to get in to a building. It's EASY to plug something in that has a known vulnerability. Even better when the person doing it has no idea what they are doing."
"Negative","my day off...awake...but still feel UGH. I couldn't sleep at all last night"
"Negative","Single node is a single point of failure. Also vVNX is not supported in production."
"Positive","Hello, twitterland! It's so nice out, but I'm inside doing work   The good thing is: I'm making progress..even processed a few orders.."
"Positive","we can now offer good services to our clients"
"Negative","Nothing is going the way it planned.....my sisters wedding is going to be incredibly hard"
"Negative","I wont buy your product because your product doesnt work! Neither version 14 nor 15"
"Positive","Disabled the Homebridge plugin and enabled the native Homekit in Hassio HomeAssistant.. Muuuuch better.. Motion sensors show up now! Homekit automations are easy!"
"Positive","Can't say I'm surprised that @netflix cancelled both Jessica Jones & The Punisher, but I'm just really hoping @MarvelStudios does the right thing and brings @jonnybernthal back when they do the Punisher! He's seriously the best portrayal of Frank Castle, hands down!"
"Positive","As someone who's been a fan longer than the name ""PernixData"" has been around, thank you for the thoughtful answer, and thanks to Matt for asking."
"Positive","As you say it could work to move hdd to other hardware but could also result in BSOD as it might not have correct drivers etc.  PhysicalHDD2VirtualHDD :) For this i can give you one example.  Req: have hdd accessible from a machine and have another place to store the copy/image. Create a bootable usb/cd with clonezilla. Start clonezilla and make a copy of the drive to a image file. And then you  create an empy VM and start clonezilla in that VM and read in the image file you have created. Simsalabim you have Phhd2Vhdd convertion done.  EDIT: Note that you boot clonezilla on usb drive and run it as a live linux without installation. You should be able to run the GUI based version, there is advance option to do a 1:1 sector copy but that is normally not needed if drive is  not encrypted or in some other strange state."
"Positive","For what it's worth if you grab your browser and unsnap it from large mode to small floating window and back again that usually gives it a good kick in the ass.  Stupid I know but it was a good day when I realized no more refreshing."
"Negative","There are no alternatives in this case unfortunately. We have to have this vendor's software for this project. What makes this even more maddening is that the vendor in question has an option to purchase a license that lasts as little as 30 days -- but don't run that license server on VMware because fuck you.  We pay for everything we use. This is yet another case where the paying customer gets fucked while the software pirates get the better user experience."
"Positive","We remodeled!   The new vSAN 6.7 delivers modern management experience for end users: http://bit.ly/2r42SjJ"
"Negative","The console opened automatically on web console but i want it to change it to open in VMRC. cant open console via VMRC."
"Positive","A good gig if you can get it, spending the peoples money with little to no accountability"
"Positive","Honestly I found that creating my nested lab by hand rather then using a pre-built option gave me the best studying for VCP and VCAP exams possible. I used AutoLab years ago but found it more difficult then just building from scratch."
"Negative","That happened to me too! I was so sad    Must Have Star Trek Glasses!"
"Positive","I see these things and ask myself ""Who stands to gain from that $200B?"" \n\nThen I wonder if Al Gore got in on this.\n\nHonest Howie's Carbon Credits should! @HowieCarrShow"
"Negative","I guess he doesn't like Concur either..."
"Positive","Dali was amazing. 200 works in one place - shame it's not travelling to brisvegas  how was davinci?"
"Positive","Considering the budget I was given I think it's somewhat solid.  I'll get them to buy Essentials, especially since they are a non-profit there would be a nice discount.  I understand I can use the one license for up to three hosts?  I'm not too worried about equipment failure as long as they stay aware of the redundant stuff failing, to stay on top of that.  They have their old host updated with 5.5 and running their redundant DC, with enough resources to bring up the VMs on the other host (they're stored on an iSCSI via Synology) in the event the server just up and dies on them.  I'm moving them to hosted Exchange to get them off 2003, so I'm not worried about their email server after next week.  As for why I want to get alerts from the device itself, I don't feel it's quite as silly as you make it sound.  If a disk or power supply fails it would email me.  If something really bad happens and the server shuts down or otherwise won't run the VMs, my monitoring/remote control agents on the Windows VMs will stop checking in and I'll get an alert.  I think that covers all my bases, insofar as being alerted.  Basically I was just looking for the server to make me aware of any warnings or alerts for the hardware it's able to monitor in Configuration  Health Status."
"Positive","that's what I said when the postman showed up and delivered it!\n\nThanks again!"
"Negative","I've had the duplicate key issue in a few labs. I have 6 environments that are all running 6.5, and I have had to shut them down multiple times for power maintenance. Every time we do a cold metal start, another instance is messed up. The vcenter HA feature helped in the few labs I implemented it in."
"Negative","Yeah it is! Thai Buddhist temples here are also showing signs of &quot;getting with the times&quot; also. Sigh."
"Negative","i want a cat like Marvin  but my papa is allergic :| And it just wont be the same if i shaved it  xxxxxx"
"Negative","tickets are open with all three vendors - they sure like to point fingers"
"Negative","youtube it papa, I just saw it right now. Its the end of the world"
"Positive","As business and technology leaders, we have a special opportunity to lead sustainability efforts by proving how innovation can be a rising tide that lifts all boats. Read my latest LinkedIn article: https://bit.ly/2EZQZ7R"
"Positive","What feature would you say is missing ? Have been using the HTML5 client for over a month and haven't noticed any.. Just curious :)"
"Positive","Many customers, when they move to 6.0, are putting both prod and DR in the same SSO domain. This is especially beneficial if you're also using SRM as SRM can leverage Cross-vCenter-vMotion. But, its just an option. Perfectly Ok to use separate PSC domains for prod/DR. Just understand the impacts/benefits/drawbacks of each option and make a choice based on your requirements."
"Positive","On ESXi, your vSwitch0 likely has you management interface on it and a VMNICx as the uplink.  Make sure this is the VMNIC that your AirPort is connected to.  Now add a Virtual Machine portgroup to vSwitch0 for your ""LAN"".  Now create vSwitch1 and a virtualmachine portgroup for your ""WAN"" and have the VMNICx that its uplinked to connected to your ISP.  Now for pfSense VM, give it two vNICs.  One connected to WAN portgroup and one connect to LAN portgroup.  Don't specify any VLAN IDs on any of the portgroups"
"Negative"," I still have to launch the thick client several times a day  Why?"
"Negative","i had a similar issue i had to update the blade fimware"
"Negative","as I said, politics .vs. Action. Both sides are guilty."
"Positive","Some extremely cool things here, much more so than vSpher 6.7u2.  Using Telegraf is a great change!"
"Positive","And SD cards are a lot cheaper than SAN storage!"
"Positive","I was first certified on 5.5 and I was a VCP5-DCV. I delta'd up to v6.0 and I then held VCP6-DCV."
"Negative","Come on Outlook. You're just a damned email client. Why do you have to be such a PITA?"
"Positive","RT @vmwarevtsp: Check out vCloud Suite Whiteboard Demo video originally for #VMware Field now available to partners. http://bit.ly/TVdDie"
"Negative","In the drive thru @ mcd's, watching the f!@*ing woman making her order waste away the last ticks on the bkfst menu by using 100 coupons."
"Negative","Your support docs are like an encyclopedia...informative, but not very helpful.  How about a few ""How to"" examples instead of just presenting the definitions and concepts"
"Negative","Don't passthrough a NIC.  You'll loose flexiblity and control without gaining anything at all."
"Negative","*gasp* oh no!! what happened? not feeling too well  back tomoz thou"
"Negative","Webclient presents text error ... potential vulnerable ...  Fat client/web client presentation I suppose.   Will rtfm on the kb.  THanks"
"Positive","Currently, im doing about 5k iops on my san with 4 hosts, 50vms. Almost 50/50 split read/write.  Not migrating. Building a new cluster. Just wanting to do it smarter with expansion in mind.  I'm based in New Zealand."
"Positive","""We now have the ability to administer health checks every hour thanks to vSAN 6.6."" @Lost_Signal #VMworld"
"Negative","These were given out to VMworld Alumni attendee's, meaning you've attended at least 3 VMworld's.  I think the policy changed from ""3 total"" to ""3 within the last 5 years"" though.  :("
"Negative","I'm having the same sort of day today"
"Negative","I was very worried about this too. Namely that it would erase all of the OSX updates I had to install :\\"
"Positive","If you need need a lot of IOPs, a Dell EqualLogic PS4210E fits the bill. You can get it in 12x2TB, 12x3TB, 12x4TB and 12x6TB.  The 12x4TB, with 3 years of ProSupport Mission Crititcal 24/7 Onsite 4 hours response time will go for around $25K CAD. I have zero visibility for US Pricing."
"Negative","\\ they probably should express these issues with the vendor.   &amp;#x200B;  EMC ""long hair don't care"" array is in the mix here, unfortunately."
"Positive","Not how it works. You'll notice that the memory stated in your host status is XX / XY GB.  During boot, it allocates a hard line in your resources for itself. Wouldn't be much of a hypervisor if it didn't do at least that, would it?   It really doesn't need much in the way of CPU on it's own, but you can also see, if you dig in, that it allocates some reserve for that as well.   I can't find it right now (on my phone in my truck before I walk into work) but I had a white paper from VMware about how to manage host resource reservations as it relates to clusters and resource pools when managing via vCenter.  Should be able to find it with some googling if you want more technical explanations from the source."
"Positive","We've reenabled TPS. Works well."
"Positive","Gotta say, I love me some app Volumes. been getting some of our mid tier guys to capture stuff. Havent really ran into many problems, except with Project, which appears to have a resolution now, so I'm happy to see this release."
"Negative","http://bit.ly/160Zgx  This one. It's hard."
"Positive","LoL..NOW I SEEM LIKE A LOSER...  HAHAHAHAH!!!"
"Negative","Just had a super tasty Chipotle lunch. Too bad more work had to follow."
"Negative","i haven't been watching anime since i've been so busyy"
"Negative","It's one of those newbie flights where people overstuff the overhead and look at you stupidly."
"Positive","Is vMotion entirely irrelevant in this case?  Isn't there still the benefit of transferring a VM from one host to the other with no downtime?  (Rather than doing it manually, shutting down them VM and using scp to copy the VM to the other host which would take the VM offline for that time)  Genuinely asking, I know very little about the higher functionality of ESXi/vCenter."
"Positive","Yes. I found more then a few that were tough calls on an answer or  two much more so then the 5.5 Delta exam"
"Negative","My multi monitors aren't working with Windows 10. I just get a black screen."
"Positive","lol! I feel a bit green around the gills today"
"Positive","thanks! And yeah, I know! How much easier it would be to just be able to explain to the kitty, like it happens with humans"
"Positive","For the sake of correctness, the strict co-scheduling you're using as an example hasn't existed since ESXi 2.x - relaxed co-scheduling has been a thing for quite a while.  There's still a bounding on how much scheduling delta is allowed between vCPUs, which can still be seen as an increase in CSTP times, but it hasn't been an ""all or nothing"" situation for quite some time."
"Positive","I too forget from time to time not everyone had enterprise plus lol"
"Positive","For what you are describing there you could run it on a single ESXi host. A typical host in our cluster is a Dell R730 with 2x20 core@2.3GHz CPUs and 768GB RAM, plus a decently fast NAS that gets shared with all the hosts. That host would run to about $20K but would do everything you talk about 5 times over.  The issue you have with a single host is redundancy. Servers these days are pretty good, but only you know how much you could cope with downtime and how much risk you could afford to take.  On a tight budget you could look at something like proxmox instead, which is actually pretty similar to VMware at the starter levels. And free."
"Negative","It's Dell's fault that VMware is including an older VIB in it's 6.0 release?"
"Positive","Highly performing and available network configuration is critical to a successful #VSAN deployment:  http://vmw.re/1W8DgMU"
"Negative","the doc says to look at the vcloud directory release notes for system requirements.  The release notes say to look here."
"Negative","Stark put on some weight.. Must be using the Mark 38 nowadays."
"Positive","YES! My VMware team has started converting all our blades to AutoDeploy. With 300+ hosts, it makes our upgrade processes quicker. We also bake in things like vendor drivers and trend into the image so it cuts down on our deployment time."
"Positive","Open the vmware network manager and make sure that the bridged adapter is using the correct adapter."
"Negative","First time boarding Southwest. This is ridiculous. ""The flight is oversold"" never happens on @JetBlue"
"Positive","We're using Skyline.  Though, I was recently granted access (couple days ago).  Does it take time for permissions to Advisor and such to take effect?  Also, in Advisor, it shows a lot of our inventory, but some clusters do not have a drop down and show individual hosts.  We did a rolling 6.7 upgrade a couple days ago, but I would think the collection is more frequent?  Can you talk about the polling/discovery timers?"
"Negative","Every person I know that's used it has told me to stay away from it. Failures tend to be serious. It's temperamental, etc."
"Negative","It's not something that will happen often and it's only a home lab so not a huge deal."
"Positive","6.7u1 has an upgrade path from 6.5u2"

"Negative","The list is huge over here. Family, friends, ex-GF, etc... It's awful."
"Positive","You will probably need to create another connection server set and a new pool on your LB, if you're wanting to use the same DNS name externally you should be able to use custom rules on your LB to change which load balanced pool of servers is being used by external users vs internal.  Alternatively you could present a different DNS record externally and point it to another VIP on your LB.   Just out of curiosity which LB are you using?"
"Negative","I am having exactly this issue today after the 5.5 upgrade.  Not to mention not being able to add in 6.5 hosts."
"Negative","Sorry to hear about your NVMe loss! Is there any way to minimize the wear vSAN puts on these drives?"
"Positive","Mildly envious of active directory/domain controller.    You can wire together stuff with OpenLDAP, Kerberos, NIS and Samba but it's still a bit fragile."
"Negative","This page is about vSphere vCenter 6.7 in HA configuration. But the requirements tell you need vCenter Server 6.5. That should be vCenter Server 6.7"
"Negative","you need to be more detailed on ALL of your documents.  The information is very lacking and very vague."
"Positive","Signal sucks here  Waiting for MIA to step onstage.  Stoked for The Killers after!"
"Negative","Re: Gaysorn. According to the website she's no longer there."
"Positive","Happy Father's Day Bill! Future #vExpert"
"Negative","5.1 isn't supported either. Is there some reason you can't go to at least 5.5?"
"Positive","Will it benefit from extra cores? If it's already got (say) 4 cores and the main application doesn't thread well, then adding more cores might not give noticeable benefit."
"Positive","end to end visibility across the entire stack"
"Positive","Yeah pretty much what I thought.   The backend is an IBM SAN with about 50 LUNs all about 1 TB in size. Each LUN is spread over many disks, but I don't have access to the configuration so don't know the RAID set up.  Guess I'll just KISS.  Thanks."

"Negative","seriously, nothing makes me angrier than a liar."
"Negative","In class again, rainy in the D this morning"
"Positive","Currently work for an MSP and we have implemented Zerto to replicate our own critical systems to our other datacenters as well as a DR solution that we sell to our customers.  It seems to work really well and is quite simple to configure and manage.  All of our clients seem to be impressed with its actual recovery time of the VM's.  Zerto also has pretty good support, every time I've called or emailed them they've been pretty responsive."
"Positive","Have the same problem all the time. Glad it helped."
"Negative","I've seen this in my lab with scaleio, the slight thing goes wrong with storage and all of a sudden the cluster is dead..  But on the other hand, running your vcsa and a psc on local storage means you lose other things.."

"Negative","Just got in from group reading &amp; told 1 person 2 B careful of speeding ticket. Well guess who got the darn speeding ticket? ME!! Figures"
"Positive","Pretty sure you can install ESXi on a system without paying for licensing. It only costs when you require a VCenter license."
"Positive","That's an interesting approach. And yeah, I'm wondering how long VMware is going to play nice with the NSX portion.  Can you do scheduled scans with this approach? Is it less resource intensive than a full agent on the VM?"
"Positive","Install VMware tools and it'll resize automatically"
"Positive","Looking into it now. Thanks for the pointer."
"Negative","I have a similar dilemma but in a University setting. Have not tried implementing this but in theory it sounds like it should work. The PCoIP server process (pcoip_server_win32.exe) is what draws the PCoIP screen. My thought was to limit the IP subnet that could connect to that process. If a user inadvertently selects the wrong pool in the wrong location they'll be greeted with a black screen and eventually will be disconnected or they could disconnect themselves. So you'd have to educate your users accordingly.  Edit: just read this is an application, so this might not work for you then if the app needs to know the MAC. Desktop wise this might work."
"Positive","Thanks.  I think we are going to try it out.  Was just initially pushing back due to the change in the infrastructure.   Did you guys start out with this config from the start or did you change things midstream?"
"Negative","They're all Westmere, which is the weird thing. Or so Intel claims"
"Negative","Sadly, correct.  May have to rebuild and move everything over"
"Positive","Not sure why but I was looking for a BBC America app. Totally spaced on PBS :)"
"Negative","there is no screenshot so I cannot tell where to find the quick  filter"
"Negative","Are you searching for the task history to find that?  That's what mine does.  Vmname, snap name, size, date taken, and something else.  At one point we were using tsmve and it was really bad about leaving snaps, so I had this running every 6 hours looking for tsm snaps that were older than a certain amount of hours.  It would automatically delete them to prevent them from taking another snap before the first was deleted."
