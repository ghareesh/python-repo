"Positive","Double check this info, but I'm quite sure the drives cannot have esxi loaded on them. This uses vflash file system instead of vmfs on the disks.   Also there isn't much point in having a raid 1 array for vflash read cache. You'd be better off just having pass through individual disks.   Also on splitting the space between VMs, your much better off finding the VMs with high read IOPS and dedicating more vflash to those."
"Positive","How cool is that!? Even our CTO is also working on his @VMware #Homelab - Just got asked to review @GregL_VMware BOM  \n\nHe's got a pretty solid kit, only minor suggestions. Hopefully Greg will consider submitting to Community Homelab BOM Project!"
"Positive","Thank you for the detailed response. The gpupdate thing I kind of suspected.  We did find the solution however, and it was actually something I had baked in to the image, but had not realized my client's domain GPOs were overwriting - They had the ""Always wait for network"" gpo forced OFF on the domain side, so despite baking it in to the image's local GPO it was being overwritten.  Sorry for the dumb question I posed here, and for taking up your time - was just hard to get clarity without visibility on both sides (I architect their horizon and advise them on GPOs, but they do all the GPO architecture and have their own policies layered on top of mine)"

"Negative","Either you or someone deleted it, it's on another datastore that isn't reachable currently, or something is off with your vmx file. A little background would help as well."

"Negative","Yea, I saw that post. Hope I don't have to delve that deep into it. I'm due for a new card next month, I hoping if it's the cipher the new card takes care of it.  It sued to work with the old version of the client but then a Win10 update messed with something and I started getting a ""Handle is in the wrong position"" error.

"Positive","You shouldn't need Dell EMC PS, my understanding is upgrade assistance is included as a nice to have in Premium support but it's not mandatory. Perhaps they are thinking you would expect them to upgrade the external vCenter, which I can understand would be chargeable as it's outside of their environment.   To upgrade yourself, you would perform the normal vCenter upgrade process. Then to upgrade the hosts and VxRail Manager, you would do that via VxRail Manager using the 4.0.400 bundle."

This was the reason I converted my storage server. It was a very good decision. It reboots at its own leisure and I rarely ever notice.   When I convert this to virtual, what sort of performance hit will I see?  Depends... Does it leverage QuickSync? You should check to see if that works in VMs. Otherwise, you shouldn't notice any meaningful difference."

"Positive","You can't remove a host from a cluster without puting it in maintenance mode. However you can disconnect/remove it. Disconnecting a host only tells vCenter to stop actively managing it. It doesn't halt running VMs or immediately wipe out configurations. You can disconnect/remove hosts from your cluster all day long without losing a single ping on your machines.   VMware does have a KB for how to migrate hosts between vCenter servers using distributed switches though, so I won't bother to regurgitate that from memory."

"Negative","Our SAN is split up into 4 datastores, each on a different set of disks, and the problem has happened on more than one. Shares stop working for the most part. When you type the path in windows explorer, it tries to connect and acts like it almost can, meaning windows explorer stops responding and my whole pc slows down. The event log of the frozen guest keeps recording events like it's still running, but I can't get it to respond to a logon. It's almost like the cpu is throttled down to 0.1% of something."

I had to customize the PCOIP (bandwidth floor,  frame rate, auido quality..) settings for everything,   I user Nvidia Grid K1  with sVGA   (I am doing vGPU testing right now , look promising)     So I found there ae some hardware settings you can set for Apex2800  to manage when it offloads a client display based on bandwidth and other things.   I changed these settings to ensure PCOIP is ALWAYS offloaded.    for me my remote users Average latency is around  250MS  and it works.   sometimes it s a matter of fine tuning the environment.  I would be happy to go more in depth on what I am doing if anyone is interested in knowing / trying"

"Positive","Yea a passthrough was in place for the HyperV machine. I did disable the passthough on the Host but probrably didnt matter after i took out the card.

"Positive","I agree that there were good people in Burlington, but Colorado also has amazing engineers there, both in Production and Premiere support groups."
"Negative","Or can the app get broken apart to different servers? Are they running the database, application, web servers, interfaces from the same server? Try breaking individual pieces apart and getting the vendor to confirm what everything needs.   We run into this a lot. You want an application that needs a 16 core VM? Great here is a quote for a new host. Let me know how you want to pay for it. To this day no VM has gotten more than 4 cores. Amazing how quickly attitudes change when you present a bill."
"Positive","Looking forward to representing VMware at this year's @GoldmanSachs Technology and Internet Conference. #GSTech2017"
"Negative","Not enough detail, an example of the settings in actual use would help."
"Positive","If the servers can support 2 CPUs (but only being shipped with 1), instead of worrying about adding more nodes and changing licensing in the future, OP can buy a 2nd CPU and more RAM for the 3 nodes he has.  Essentials and Essentials Plus support up to 2 CPUs in each server.       And in modern servers, the CPU is the memory controller.  So adding a 2nd CPU also doubles the memory capacity of each server."

"Positive","What kind of host hardware are you running? We ran into a similar issue, it ended up being the host's NIC drivers (Intel x710 i think).
