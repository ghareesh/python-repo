The first group, my pilot group, was running VMware Workstation on standalone workstations.  They had a little shadow IT thing going on with some extra NICs and a Linksys router and some internet connection sharing going on - one of the security guys flipped and told them to rip it out... so we went with a small vRA deployment.  Then one of those guys moved from a development shop to a testing shop, told his friends and boom, I had a second tenant.  /Dev and /QC.  Then a couple of security engineers needed a place to work on a new image so /Sec was born, then a group that was doing some other dev work, then the guys at out other site... and now things are getting out of control."

"Positive","Esxi has been pretty nice as it plugs right in to VMware workstation on my desktop. We also use esxi and VMware workstation at work so it's been convenient for those reasons. Currently running the following services. Blueiris Plex, file server TP-Link Omada (and system I use for managing switches) Domain controller   I could probably get away with a sata controller, the chance I would get a SAS drive is pretty low but I like to have the option available.

"Negative","Hello,  The person you replied to is correct. This is an issue/bug where vCD constantly sees vCenter in a busy state. You will need to bring down the cells, run the whack script (clears quartz and inventory tables) and restart the cells.  Please open a support case so we can provide the whack script to you with the exact steps.  Sometimes, performing a reconnect and then a refresh will do the trick, but often times it will throw the same error.   Edit: I took a look at the KB, and that is the jist of the whack script. It wouldn't remove the datastore tags, just need to bring the cells down, run the script and bring the cells back online.   I would also ask what version of vCD and vCenter do you have? We've not seen this issue in later versions (typically vcd 5.5.6.1/8.10)"

Further, when your superiors flat out refuse to listen that your software isn't designed for AWS, it's legacy turtles all the way down, none of this cool new containerized microservice stuff, and AWS will lead to data loss and downtime?  I view AWS as an evolution of devs renting a VPS and calling it a robust solution. Despite all the things I've read about ""Devops needing ops"" every time I've seen it done, it looks an awful lot like Devs kicking out ops because they're sick of our nagging about things like availability and data loss."

"Negative","Your issue is the thin provisioning. VMware will present 128GB to the OS even if there is not 128GB worth of space left on the datastore. Once the datastore fills up...game over, you need more physical storage. This is why thin provisioning is both a blessing and a curse. I work for an MSP and there is no way we can keep track of storage like that for 300+ clients so by rule of thumb we ALWAYS use thick provisioning. This way the OS will get it's space and it will be ""earmarked"" on the datastore, if it's not available on the datastore ESXi won't let you create the disk."

"Negative","u/DukieDust Let's get some things straight :).  1. When you are logging in, so you have been authenticated, and you remove yourself from the AD group, you are probably still logged in and can still do stuff. What I'm trying to say here; you don't need to relog (99% of the time) to receive more/less permissions in vCenter. 2. When you use AD based authentication for your users to connect to vCenter, the PSC will handle the SSO stuff and authentication with the Active Directory. This does not mean you are authorized to login! When you do, like you said, you receive an error like the one below (in a big red popping line):`Unable to login because you do not have permission on any vCenter Server systems connected to this client` 3. When you want your users to login to the vCenter, you are going to have to assign permissions on objects. Albeit vCenter, Cluster, Hosts, Folders, VM's etc. etc. 4. So because you can still login, you probably still have permissions on (some) items somewhere in the vCenter Appliance.  As far as I'm concerned there is something funky going on with the permissions you may or may not have assigned somewhere in the vCenter Appliance inventory... Please do check this.  It might also be a timeout issue in the SSO configuration for password expiring aging or something like that. I'd wait an hour, which is the default timeout.  So what you can check;  * Go to Administration - Roles - check each role if you or the Domain Users group is assigned to any role you have in the vCenter. To this this intensly quick use:`Get-VIPermission | ?{$_.Principal -like ""*Thibaut*""}`on a PowerShell session :). * Go to Administration - Global Roles - do the same as the one above. * Remove any unwanted groups that are still there in Administration - Single Sing On - Users and Groups. * Doublecheck the sessions in vCenter like somebody already said before. Just to be sure.     EDIT: I did this exact same procedure on one of our production vCenters, and I am getting the same result as u/DukieDust. Haha alright, this is something funky. I will get back to you guys tomorrow to check and see if it's a timeout thing or not."

"Positive","Backup the VM, rebuild the host as VMware, bare metal restore the VM in VMware.  You will have downtime.  No way around that with another host to migrate to."
"Positive","Well...that is actually pretty normal.  I have had that setup to deal with in nearly every one of my positions.  The only domain info that matters to vCenter and its supporting apps, from an access control standpoint, is the one that it is housed in.  As long as all of your vCenter infrastructure is in a single namespace, then you need not worry about the VMs themselves being disjointed.  Additionally, you can still provide user access from any domain by just adding that domain to the identity sources."
"Positive","I just did this in our Lab to make security happy. They wanted the Lab VC and the Lab ESXi Hosts on their own separate vLAN.   We don't have  management network on a Distributed vSwitch so we took one of the two NIC out of vSwitch0 and created a new vSwitch1 with the new Management IP address and made sure it was accessible via the new IP.  We then changed the vLAN setting on the Lab VC (which is virtual) and changed the IP Address and the DNS entry along with restarting the vCenter Services.   After this was done we deleted the DNS entry for the old IPs for the Lab ESXi machines and moved it over to the new IPs. Once this was done we updated DNS on the Lab VC and all of the hosts reconnected.  One thing that was over looked was that VUM wasn't working since it was originally configured to listen on the IP address which no longer exists. A quick change in the Admin settings and a restart of the services took care of that problem."
"Positive","WSUS still makes sense.  I don't manage desktops, I take care of infrastructure, I don't care about patching applications.  I manage a couple hundred window servers in WSUS, for the person who does application management on desktops we have PDQ Deploy which is a damned awesome tool."
