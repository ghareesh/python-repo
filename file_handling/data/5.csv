"Negative","Ugh! I hate swimming! I still wanna be asleep!"
"Positive","Truly well deserved, great job!"
"Negative","Yes. Alternately (in vCenter at least), there's an option to remove the file from the datastore when you remove it from the VM.  EDIT: Just tried and I see the same thing on a host without a vCenter server. Both are running 6.7."
"Negative","Look at the title being put forward, the information on the page is useless to answer the title's topics.  The page doesn't even mention site names"
"Negative","It's gone. Trust me. You can search for .vmdk files (these are the disks) - But I'm guessing you thin provisioned and fedora only took up a few GB so when you deleted it you didn't notice 20gb being freed up, because it didn't take up 20gb in the first place."
"Negative","aw i know! i was sooooo sad today about this whole thing. i sooo bad to meet her  BUT i'll someday, i just wished it was soon!"
"Negative","Sorry to be dim but is this a Windows VM only thing?"
"Positive","never said otherwise. i suggest you already gain experience with the vsphere suite before going a layer up ;) maybe the first thing would be searching some documentation on different vmware products to understand how they articulate between themselves before skipping to ""chapter 250 : download the stuff"" ..."
"Positive","Thank you for the info and that really sucks. I used to manage an Openstack cluster on KVM a few years ago and it was not fun. VIO made things too easy, especially with NSX. I think I am going to build a 3.1 Openstack lab and reverse engineer the configs to build my own. I don't see much help online for people who want to use VMware with Openstack with NSX in play.  Also, I wonder if it will ever get added to VMUG Advantage. I hope it does."
"Positive","Is headed home from falls creek  27 disicions awesome is all i have to say!"
"Negative","Why the fuck can't I change video memory in vsphere 6.5 without fucking around with 3D and passthrough? I just want a decent fucking resolution."
"Positive","Yes, if we were to go the route of running the server on the bare hardware, we would utilize clustering technologies."
"Negative","saw &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot;.... ummmmmmmmm let's just say"
"Positive","New cluster after New years. Will be AMD rome"
"Positive","Meh - I've seen it happen with 100% read on 512byte IOs....even without disk cache.    But your point is well taken....even 100 IOPs is a stretch, and latency matters as much as IOPs."
"Positive","Quicker online access to reports and catalogues"
"Positive","The linux vm should remain up all the time.  It's not possible to create snapshots of vms with shared disks.  I've tested my processing with a smb share but there's a perf hit that I'd prefer to avoid, I wouldn't mind using the network if the performance was as good, but I can't figure out how to achieve this."
"Positive","So then you don't need to worry about vMotion, distributed switches or any of the other fancy features of ESXi.  I would suggest you get one to two more hosts and shared storage so you can properly leverage it's capabilities but it sounds like from your host description below that would be significant overkill for you deployment.  You'll be fine with standard."
"Negative","I make it clear that stuff like this is making it increasingly hard to be a fan."
"Negative","Sitting in the garden revising and I'm b o r e d"
"Positive","We've got an amazing slate of showcase keynotes scheduled for #VMworld. We're covering everything from the #digitalworkspace to the Virtual Cloud Network & the journey from data center to #cloud. Be sure to check out these talks this year.  http://bit.ly/2OXDt4I"
"Negative","So drugged up right now and I'm still in pain"
"Positive","Looks like it is an issue with the rollup iso. Use ""VMware-VMvisor-Installer-5.5.0.update01-1623387.x86_64.iso instead, this works for me."
"Positive","Found the problem.   Basically the port channel on the B side of the ucs was mis configured.  this meant that it was trying to go out the vnic that was associated with the b side first.  (probably the primary at the moment)"
"Positive","And for the usage OP mentions, i3/i5s with 8Gb RAM already solve the equation."
"Positive","Sweet picture @verkoren. I love cats. That is why I follow @Sockington, even though he doesn't follow me back."
"Positive","Sweet.. I wish I had your home lab. :)"
"Positive","don't worry about it. i've cleaned up 3tb snapshots"
"Negative","This page is too detailed or hard to understand."
"Negative","I've not seen this issue with the Dell Images I have used, although they have been for 5.5.  Have you tried just letting VUM update them? Maybe there is a slight difference? What does VUM say it will be updating/upgrading?   It could also be a glitch with VUM with it moving to the VCSA/Web Client (possible I guess)"
"Negative","It should be because if I run it on a NAT based network I get the expected functionality, but only when I try to put it on a LAN network with the router does it go feelsbadman"
"Negative","That's what I'm wondering. The cable is running through conduit. :("
"Positive","Thanks for this. I notice they don't have a 5.5 yet. But hey, at least it's something."
"Positive","Glad it's Friday - It's been a sickly week"
"Positive","I'm going to double check, but I believe so."
"Positive","Yesssssssssssssssssssssss is working.  Thanks a ton!"
"Negative","oh so tempting but i'm already going on a holiday to sydney &amp; melbourne in june/july so i won't have money to spare."
"Positive","Do those vouchers count for VCAP level? Most don't do VCP and VCAP because of the price difference. You can do the delta to VCP6. And then get like the NV, DTM, or CMA depending on your interest."
"Positive","I appreciate this. Many do not. Good on you, keep that environment tight."
"Negative"," I had two cases open and scheduled calls with two support engineers that no-showed. Then called me an hour past the date to apologize and wanted to work on the issue.   This is so accurate it hurts.  Microsoft is really bad about it lately as well."
"Positive","Looks like it's time for some updates, thanks!"
"Negative","Epic ocd moment? I deleted my sims file that i spent hours building just because i set his favorite food wrong"
"Positive","Do you happen to have a write up of this ghetto method by chance? As that would be useful for my homelab as my UPS is USB."
"Positive","I carve out 2TB LUNs from my Pure arrays and then add them all to a Datastore Cluster and let VMWare rebalance as needed.  Actual utilization is monitored on the arrays themselves."
"Positive","I would love to use this in my home lab!!!!!  It would ROCK!!!!!   I already have a small rack I could put it in!"
"Positive","RT @VMwareCareers VMware = Green ""In 2010 (ytd), we are diverting over 90 percent of our waste from going to the landfill."" - Doris Lippitt"
"Negative","why build a small portable esxi server? Why for 6.5?   And regarding the build itself it's bad. Go Ryzen, don't get a 1 gorillion Dollar mainboard, no RGB RAM and a normal air cooler."
"Positive","Left it overnight and still didn't go through the process.  I just created a new template without applying the GPO settings and everything work from the new template."
"Positive","We downgraded to 6.5 and have a performance increase. Fortunately we where doing some test before going on production and we don't mess with vm ."
"Negative","has abandoned the idea of wearing a dress for the forest  its too cold"
"Negative","yea, else someone will be asking, how do I change that property as it wasn't clear in the article what/how? :)"
"Negative","You're probably using even if you don't realise it, or will. Downloads, webinars, etc. And if you don't have support, and something goes catastrophically wrong, it's all going to be down to you and you alone, Mr VCP."
"Negative","the diagram needs to be updated. it shows 6 hosts of less. but consolidated architecture supports >6 hosts."
"Positive","Ok so I figured it out! I did all of your suggestions including calling VMware support. All I had to do was clear the cache on my browser or use a different browser like chrome. I found a fourm online with the same issue. Thank you for your help!"
"Negative","I want some of these for our local VMUG :("
"Positive","Tesla, GRID and Quadro cards should work. I got three hosts running PCI passthrough with GRID K1-cards."
"Negative","Could not purchase license for workstation player.   When I clicked on the ""buy"" link was taken to a site for workstation pro, rather than a site to purchase license for worlstation player.   Please fix this."
"Negative","owchie... I fell down and hurt my self"
"Positive","I agree, can't see how this would help.    I've twice hit the same problem with iSCSI attached Compellent storage, only answer every time was to add more spindles.    There's always been a verbal rule of thumb passed around NetApp users to never go over 80% full that whilst everything still works performance starts to degrade at that point - I found the same to be true for Compellent and it sounds like you are seeing the same."
"Positive","Veracrypt is a fork of Truecrypt and is being actively developed.  ""Trust"" is a hard word to apply to any kind of software these days."
"Positive","A new #vSAN training class - vSAN Production Operations - now available  http://bit.ly/2n6e65j  via @CormacJHogan"
"Negative","Yea, NetGear, you got a crappy support review. I will NOT pay for support on a product that is broken. Last time."
"Negative","2nd or 3rd time this week two C-130's went over my house at about 1500-2000'. One right after each other. \n\nNothing on Flightaware. Weird."
"Positive",".@vBrianGraf @Emad_Younis @dennisgoblu it was the first thing I had asked for :) The easiest way to deliver agility to customers"
"Negative","Hrm, looks right to me but I haven't used the one of those in vCenter directly in a long time.  I went back and looked at the docs and vRA is definitely leveraging the guest specs, so I'm not sure what exactly is going wrong for you. Do you see a task for a VM you've tried deploying that said ""customizing virtual machine"" or ""customizing guest OS"" or something similar? I know that's part of the deployment tasks when vRA clones VMs out."
"Negative","HCL was a factor, I wasn't sure at what point it was going to hinder me. If it's just a matter of support, I can live without. Craigslist search for Xeon workstations may be my route."
"Negative","Where is contentid located for a document that is uploaded into Workspace ONE? There is not field called contentid."
"Negative","vPlex is dumb no Logic at all. The benefit of Storage Virtualization is in having a  ""Logic"" of the Storage Virtualization Nodes and not of the storage subsystems. I installed various SVC Clusters and can say That IBM SVC is a real Storage Virtualization  Product."
"Positive","Well done dude..I like the once picture/one task. Hmmm... Got me thinking..."
"Positive","Thank god for vDS... All I can say about that."
"Negative","Coming from a traditional server virtualization background, yes that is what makes sense. Once you have your base image, patched and ready to go - consolidate (delete snapshots) and you are gold.   I think in the VDI world, it is done a little differently??  Someone above was implying in VDI world, that many snapshots had no effect on performance. It might be negligible or an acceptable performance hit but I was taking issue with the no effect statement."
"Positive","THANK YOU !!  Even that page leaves out a navigational step (Home - Inventory - then the rest of the path they describe), but I was able to figure that out at least."
"Negative","I was unable to find any /hgfs file under the /mnt directory. Is it different for different Distros."
"Negative","could be they dont have a 6.7 driver too. id probably go back to the 6.5 u3 image and try that if it doesnt work."
"Negative","Is missing the Downloads links for the Products"
"Negative","Its sticking around but it's getting a makeover. The full client is also sticking around from the look of it despite pripr statements that it wasn't. VMWare is keenly aware of the hate for the current web client. It was discussed by them in several sessions at VMWorld this year."
"Negative","I'm probably going to stop now. It's depressing me how much damage you've caused to my life and wellbeing."
"Negative","absolutly exhausted, not excited for work tomorrow"
"Positive","Thank you so much for the answer.   Is there some more tricky settings for performance like that one beside increasing vCores/Ram on Virtual Machines ?"
"Positive","I have this certification and just checked the expire date in the certificate manager of VMware. It never expires."
"Negative","Got to start studying before its too late. Already feels like that"
"Negative","it showed. I wish you guys got another season or two. :("
"Negative","The vcp in nsxt is due to drop soon too.  I'm holding out for that one myself"
"Positive","Thanks for the info, I will try these out in a bit when we are back from lunch!"
"Negative","If security is too hard or too expensive to implement then people won't use it or they'll look elsewhere."
"Positive","I just subbed to subreddit and YouTube.  I was already subbed to /r/homelab /r/unraid a few networking subs. It's mostly hobby, but I am striving towards a tech career."
"Negative","I feel like they have chosen poorly, I suspect Hyper-V is going to surpass them in manageability because of this. Our shop is already planning a migration to Hyper-V because of the costs savings and we aren't a small shop.  I don't understand why having a cross platform interface is mutually exclusive to having a fat client other than them not wanting to maintain both."
"Positive","Agreed. No slight to the movie, I just wanted to see more."
"Negative","Heres hoping miss miranda gets to work early"
"Negative","damnit i lost croquet now i owe my dad 30 bucks nd i cant buy the MM cd"
"Positive","Want a quick lesson on storage? @leecaswell breaks\nit down for you, here: http://bit.ly/2kGMCmV"
"Negative","I've had one session moved to a bigger room 4 times, and another had a repeat added between session builder opening, and the day of. Don't worry about it. Worst case just get in the standby line and you'll get in."
"Negative","Has no one to hang out with today"
"Negative","I'm confused as to what you are doing.  Is Ubuntu running a VMware workstation hypervisor? Are there any VMs running in the hypervisor?  I assume you are running Chrome locally in Ubuntu. Can you replicate the freeze with a song playing to see if that hangs up? Can you replicate the problem if the hypervisor is closed but the song still playing?"
"Positive","Zerto is fairly flexible, it's worth having a chat with them :)  The cost of getting something that works out of the gate vs. something that will cost you extra down the road to make it work is something to consider too."
"Negative","Would be nice to have a list of possible arguments."
"Negative","@SFoskett I'll need Exchange support for that. :("
"Positive","I wouldn't want to run any VMs on a machine with those specs. Windows 10 will fill over 2GB on my machines just idling. You need more RAM, at the least.  If you want to try anyway, you can download both VirtualBox and VMware Player for free, and see how they perform.  My desktop is a cheap ($560) refurbished HP uATX system with a Ryzen 1700, AMD RX550, and 16GB RAM. It came with a slow HDD, but I installed an NVME SSD for the OS and a SATA SSD for the VMs, and just use the HDD for backups. I can run 2 VMs with 2-4 cores and 5GB RAM each and the machine hardly knows they're there. I use VMware Workstation and Linux, but the performance is the same under Windows. Look for a deal on a machine like that with a Ryzen 2nd Gen CPU and you'll be very happy."
"Positive","Yea, I'd stick with the Intel as well. The new 14nm chips are really nice."
"Negative","It's not a vulnerability if you are logged in as root and can run an arbitrary program.\n\nGo away and re-examine your career choices."
"Negative","Right. But potentially annoying as a storage admin."
"Negative","I am trying to learn how to log into a guest operating system to install vmware tools, but don't know how to do that."
"Negative","does not indicate that you need an enterprise license for most of these features."
"Positive","but hey.. anthony rapp replied to you! and @WEARETHEFALLEN 'S SINGLE COMES OUT ON MONDAY BE EXCITED."
"Negative","If you're going with spinning rust for anything other than nearline storage (at the closest), you're going to have a bad time. Always have SSDs as the first point of impact where data storage is concerned."
"Positive","You do s swing migration. Stand up the new 6.7 vcsa, drop esxi hosts from old, adopt from new vcsa."
"Positive","Well yea that'll probably do it."
"Positive","no need. just define which esxi it is sitting on. this way you can connect to it directly."
"Negative","What?!?! No more George on G.A.?! That's not good."
"Positive","This is VERY timely for me right now. Have a deployment to setup this week and this should make it easier."
"Positive","Alright, going to check that out, thank you."
"Negative"," starts crashing  In the year 2016...VMware sign up sites still don't work."
"Negative","\\^ Exactly this. Sorry OP, but you are setting yourself up to fail by going the cheap route. We always have 3 options in IT:    1.) Fast   2.) Done well   3.) Inexpensive     You can pick 2 out of 3, but you DO NOT get all 3!"
"Negative","College? On a Sunday?! This is madness!  Only 3 days until our exam...Oh dear. But it's ok, I have the mittens."
"Negative","This process doesn't work in MacOS 10.11 and above"
"Positive","VMwares documentation is very good imo, I would start there. I agree with the other poster that you should try out powercli, they have a cmdlet called Get-EsxCli that is a pain-free way to get info and manipulate it using powershell."
"Positive","Is the Kieth Barker one better than the Greg Shields one? I've got access to both because work has a subscription to CBT Nuggets for their employees to use. Maybe I'll just go through both."
"Positive","Our 4 TOR switches (2 per rack, 15 nodes per rack), are interconnected at 40G and 40G to the core.  &amp;#x200B;  We use 2 x 10G links for replication and 2 x 25G for vsan/vm/vmotion.  &amp;#x200B;  I've used the 9K switches in other setups, but not with stacks this large. (Mostly because the networking guy loved getting the free tickets and hotel to Cisco Live the 3 times he bought them.)"
"Positive","Win a pass to #VMworld by sharing your #VSAN story! VMworld is right around the corner, so submit today!  http://fb.me/2jamngp91"
"Negative","My guess would be the VMotion network because why would they switch the basics for a cold migration. But I can't confirm this."
"Positive","Great news! I saw your response below just a few minutes ago. I could see your issue.   Yeah, trying to put something directly in the /vmfs directory won't work. /vmfs is more of a mount point then a real folder where files can reside."
"Negative","I so wanna go bck 2 sleep, but Ki ain't havin it!  I'm tired!"
"Positive","http://ow.ly/fCkTu  Join Rick Jackson, VMware, CMO on December 4 for a special vmLIVE on the Software Defined Datacenter. Register today."
"Negative","Yeah.  Freaked out my users, since I have to give them r/o visibility into things they shouldn't normally see.  Also caused some automation in QA to go bad since they could then see multiple folders named the same thing.  Whoopsie."
"Negative","http://ping.fm/p/WD3NY - This isn't Fred. This is his friend Ted. He met Chef Tomm. Poor Ted. Soon he'll be dead"
"Negative","oh yea. One Irish guy slaggin another Irish guy. :)"
"Negative","Need a screenshot!!! for the location of the ""Sessions"" button in vSphere client to check users logged into vCenter."
"Negative","You're missing what I am saying.  The existing VM  You said it gets a ip but that IP does not show in DHCP console  What does the existing VM  say the DHCP server is  We are trying to confirm your IP settings here"
"Positive","For anyone interested I managed to get it working by uninstalling open-vm-tools and installing vmware tools, then running the configure script."
"Negative","Yeah I'm fully aware. My boss doesn't want to drop another $9k on a new server. I understand how stupid it is, I've told him that if we go through with it that we won't have any official support"
"Negative","Cloud Station is frustrating. I don't want to sync anything to my iPad, just see files and click to download."
"Positive","I grew up farming, and it's amazing to me that we're reaching a new level of collaboration between #code and crops. http://econ.st/2d9kWVx"
"Negative","Did you run into any issues first loading 6.0?  I have an HP ML350p Gen8 with 2 K1s at home and when I loaded 6 it took the install but then barfed on boot.  Haven't had much time to look into it."
"Negative","GUI must be flash for step 2 to work."
"Negative","I shit you not someone walked up to me yesterday and asked if VMware supports DLC protocol."
"Negative","it states scheduled tasks in 6.7 are under ""Monitor, Tasks & Events"".  It actually located under ""Configure, More, Scheduled Tasks"""
"Negative","You honestly dont belong in IT. If powercli is ""hacky"" you... are well.. just silly."
"Positive","For employees VMware will reimburse up to $5k for a graduate degree. (When you're not pursuing a degree you can otherwise receive up to this much per year reimbursed for attending relevant conferences etc)"
"Negative","@pmarca Jeff Warner likes to ignore that opening the floodgates of illegal immigration not a solution to the problem"
"Negative","bored...  so tired... wish i could get &quot;discoverd&quot; know i have a great voice but... ;("
"Positive","Join our experts as they discuss #VVols and how you can use it it to your benefit. Session #STO8694 at #VMworld:  http://bit.ly/2dSlZrI"
"Negative","Never mind those 16 vCPUs -- it's just the total vCPUs allocated by all VMs.  Anyways, I dialed the VM down to 2 vCPUs. Results were about the same: ~89MB/s Read, ~85MB/s Write on SeqQ32T1 with average VM 2CPU usage (as per Task Manager) hovering at around 80% in the worst case during the benchmark (the host was fine, with CPU load as 0.12, 0.13, 0.13 -- not sure if this is the best method, let me know if you'd like to see it through a different one)."
"Positive","PDT and as much as I appreciate the offer, you know I can't give you access to our network."
"Positive","To ELI5 let's try an analogy.  Scenario A:  Your storage admin is a bus route planner. They have a number of buses (LUNs) each with a specific number of seats (capacity). The planner has to decide how many buses are going to travel each route (let's say the route is the capability of the LUN). Each bus is identified by a number, like the 902.  The person provisioning the virtual machine is someone trying to get their elderly relative (the Virtual Machine) who was in town visiting to the right destination (the right capabilities). When using a bus (the LUN analogy) they have to figure out which bus to put their relative on by trying to decipher a bus schedule (or spreadsheet mapping LUNs with specific capabilities to datastores). They also have to worry about ensuring they can get the relative onto the bus (that there's enough seats/capacity) and that they don't have to wait for the next bus (or for the storage admin to provision a new LUN with the right capabilities).   Scenario B:  Your storage admin is Uber. They have a number of drivers each with a specific number of seats (capacity). The storage admin has to ensure there are enough drivers to serve their city (based on demand forecasting) and recruiting enough drivers (procuring enough storage).  The person provisioning the VM is trying to deploy their VM (the elderly relative) with the right capabilities. In this scenario they simply request an Uber car to take their relative to the right location. They don't have to worry about waiting for a bus to be ready, or worrying about which other passengers are on that LUN.  Now for ELI I'm a VI admin:  SPBM and VVol turn the conversation from having to preallocate capacity and capabilities to LUNs before you are able to provision a VM, to requesting the capacity and capability your workload requires when you need it and it being configured and consumed dynamically on the storage array.  Storage admins are responsible for setting up their array, the paths to it, and the capabilities it advertises. VI admins are responsible for setting up storage profiles (in SPBM) that use those advertised capabilities, they then use those profiles when provisioning VMs to inform the storage system what capabilities they want to be provided for a particular VM when it is provisioned.  VVols also allows you to offload lots of storage operations onto the array itself (snapshotting cloning etc) at a per VM/Virtual Disk level rather than per-LUN."
"Negative","Can you migrate the VM to another ESX to see if it is a host-specific issue?  If you happen to have an ESX 5.0 host all the better ..."
"Positive","But where's the redundancy? vSAN and vSphere are usually the expensive option but ROBO licensing is a good deal for what you get."
"Negative","To be honest, I hate all your contest ideas."

"Negative","Thanks guys... no matter what I did I could not get this going so I ended up just using a couple of hard drives I had laying around and built another RAID-1 array and installed it there."
"Negative","@tapbots Yea, me too. And I don't want to."
"Positive","We'll be trying to that first, benchmark 1TB config on one node and observe the results.  I am looking at it from the perspective of if 267Mhz degradation is really going to be have such a noticeable impact in this day and age...   I guess it all just depends."

"Positive","It's technically for both a homelab as well as a dev environment/ repository. So I'm trying to treat it as important but just under startup level.  Sorry I don't need the mongo to be read many just other clusters/pods.   Your iscsi reply basically answers that. So thanks already!   I'm surprised csi is the newer method considering these docs: https://cloud-provider-vsphere.sigs.k8s.io/tutorials/kubernetes-on-vsphere-with-kubeadm.html I did set that up and when I finally got it I decided it was a huge pain but I guess if you just set it up in the template once it may not be so bad. I'm in central time zone. thanks again for all the help!"

Was the reason we removed it from vCenter in the first place.  &amp;#x200B;  PS. it's not the fiber, since this is TwinAX and the cable has been replaced today.      username@nas:~$ iperf3 -c 192.168.5.123     Connecting to host 192.168.5.123, port 5201     [  4] local 192.168.5.1 port 36346 connected to 192.168.5.123 port 5201     [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth       Retr  Cwnd     [  4]   0.00-1.00   sec   351 MBytes  2.95 Gbits/sec  1154   5.66 KBytes            [  4]   1.00-2.00   sec  1.74 MBytes  14.6 Mbits/sec  344   7.07 KBytes            [  4]   2.00-3.00   sec  3.23 MBytes  27.1 Mbits/sec  687   1.41 KBytes            [  4]   3.00-4.00   sec  1.55 MBytes  13.0 Mbits/sec  340   1.41 KBytes            [  4]   4.00-5.00   sec  3.42 MBytes  28.7 Mbits/sec  607   5.66 KBytes            [  4]   5.00-6.00   sec  2.98 MBytes  25.0 Mbits/sec  474   8.48 KBytes            [  4]   6.00-7.00   sec  2.24 MBytes  18.8 Mbits/sec  383   4.24 KBytes            [  4]   7.00-8.00   sec  3.23 MBytes  27.1 Mbits/sec  577   9.90 KBytes            [  4]   8.00-9.00   sec  1.55 MBytes  13.0 Mbits/sec  343   4.24 KBytes            [  4]   9.00-10.00  sec  2.50 MBytes  21.0 Mbits/sec  483   1.41 KBytes            - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -     [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth       Retr     [  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   374 MBytes   313 Mbits/sec  5392             sender     [  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   370 MBytes   310 Mbits/sec                  receiver          iperf Done.     username@nas:~$ iperf3 -s     -----------------------------------------------------------     Server listening on 5201     -----------------------------------------------------------     Accepted connection from 192.168.5.123, port 39472     [  5] local 192.168.5.1 port 5201 connected to 192.168.5.123 port 39474     [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth     [  5]   0.00-1.00   sec   999 MBytes  8.38 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   1.00-2.00   sec  1.08 GBytes  9.24 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   2.00-3.00   sec  1.07 GBytes  9.19 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   3.00-4.00   sec  1.07 GBytes  9.19 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   4.00-5.00   sec  1.07 GBytes  9.18 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   5.00-6.00   sec  1.07 GBytes  9.16 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   6.00-7.00   sec  1.05 GBytes  9.05 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   7.00-8.00   sec  1.06 GBytes  9.07 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   8.00-9.00   sec  1.07 GBytes  9.21 Gbits/sec                       [  5]   9.00-10.00  sec  1.06 GBytes  9.14 Gbits/sec                       [  5]  10.00-10.04  sec  43.1 MBytes  9.22 Gbits/sec                       - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -     [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth     [  5]   0.00-10.04  sec  0.00 Bytes  0.00 bits/sec                  sender     [  5]   0.00-10.04  sec  10.6 GBytes  9.08 Gbits/sec                  receiver     -----------------------------------------------------------     Server listening on 5201     -----------------------------------------------------------     ^Ciperf3: interrupt - the server has terminated     username@nas:~$"
"Negative","aww I tried to listen but apparently I don't have the right program to dl the file"
"Positive","Well, it WAS the 80's and the Air Guard wasn't activated very often, if at all. \n\nI don't regret not going to the Sandbox."
"Positive","wow, congrats dude! That's huge and great looking couple"
"Negative",". Not happening. Do you know how lame that'd beeee?"
"Negative","Thanks I'll give that a go. It seems I can get it going if I leave the process in the background, the GUI launches in like 10 or so minutes, but I still don't know what's causing it to hang. And it persists after a system restart and even reinstallation of the vsphere client software."
"Negative","not really, just want to script it. cause i want use less GUI, just want to ssh into machine."
"Negative","This is not useful, provide more information: ""Realize Automation logs failures. To identify the problem, review the logs."""
"Negative","This page is missing steps. The directions were followed and did not work."
"Negative","I'll chime in on this one... Last RAID-5 failure I had was on an EMC NS-960. We had a failed SAS 10K 600GB drive in say DAE 5 Slot 11. The EMC Tech came out, swapped the drive out and left as they normally do. About two hours into the rebuild, DAE 5 Slot 3 failed of the same type. EMC was called back in, Engineering got involved and they spent the next 2 days (without leaving the datacenter) tweaking the rebuilt rates and finagling both drives to keep them up long enough to rebuild. Two days with an entire aggregate offline was hell enough for us that we decided to go RAID-6 on everything.   EDIT: You will note that as of the VNX1 the rebuild rate is MUCH lower... Meaning, it now takes 30% longer to rebuild arrays. This was done specifically to mitigate the types of issues like the one I incurred on my NS-960. However, I know from chaps in the VCE User Group for example that it can and does still happen. Albeit less often, these types of failures are simply par for RAID-5."
"Positive","Careful, I might take you up on that offer! ;)"
"Positive","Would really be nice if our Corp View desktops ran all the latest version C# Client, PowerCLI, etc."
"Negative","ok. well, i came in too late to have any fun. clashing events"
"Positive","I really appreciate the info. I have been trying to learn more about this topic for the last month or so, but most information has not been able to ""ground"" the topic so to speak, while your info here has. Thanks!"
"Negative","also, i am so sunburnt i'm questioning my ability to wear a bra to work today   or pants for that matter."
"Negative","yes web client on vsphere 6. I'm doing it exactly as the girl in the vid: going to inventory, going to a host, selecting a vm, right click. In the context menu i dont have anywhere the option to select scheduled tasks and i dont have the clock symbol anywhere in the context menu. Actually i'm testing it with a single VM (and not yet multi select) -- i'm selecting it under the related objects as you have wrote."
"Negative","think i pulled a muscle in my shoulder"
"Positive","I would say altogether we are happy with the modified version of applications"
