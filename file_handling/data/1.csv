"Positive","Are all three hosts providing storage/capacity? Or is one a witness? If all three have capacity drives, what'd you do with the witness? (and with them being NUCs, just how are you handling capacity and cache?)  I'm really wondering about two-node performance, as I currently have three hosts but one of them has FreeNAS virtualized and all the disk slots on that host are dedicated for that. I could add a DAS shelf or something, but I am very curious what it's like running v SAN with both capacity/cache only attached to two nodes and as far as the cluster is aware the third host is strictly only a VM host. And if that's where I'm heading, is the StarWind route going to offer something for performance and reliability with two storage nodes that VMware vSAN wouldn't be able to match with only two storage nodes?"

"Negative","Can not find this. In the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface, select Syslog. If I saw something labeled syslog, I wouldnt be in this KB. Need more steps to what this is. I am loged in to the VCSA Web admin portal but no idea where the syslog button is."
"Negative","As a last ditch effort I tried vCenter Converter and am managing to maintain a 2Gbps throughput to a Windows VM located on that same host using a different SSD array.  Still nowhere near what it's capable of, but much better.  This should only take an hour or so and hopefully finish.  I never could get the native OVF export to finish downloading the vDisk.  It always stopped the transfer well before reaching 100GB"
"Negative","Yes I found that and would agree, except that it was working great until the App Volumes agent update.  Edit: verified I'm on VMFS 5"

"Negative","Morning all.. I hate weekends online; crazy busy in World of Warcraft but my email accounts are so so quiet"
"Negative","DUDE.... i need to do my hair for reals!!!!! ehhhh Im too lazy tho!"
"Negative","it is not one of those reasons listed.  I will check the EVC level.  What is odd is that it is not the same for every VM.  I can migrate some VM's in the same cluster to to same host pair but it will give me this error.  Then I can pick a different VM and it will migrate fine."
"Negative","Not sure why I wasn't seeing this before.. Sigh. I'm kinda stressed out right now I guess."
"Negative","The issue is with the cpu not with the hypervisor. Same rules apply"
"Negative","yea i installed the vsan mp, so far it seems pretty worthless in my opinion."
"Negative","I have A02, Build# 10302608 on two R710 with Low Volt 5600 CPUs. 5630 and 5640 I think (got X5670 on shelf). They were 6.5 then 6.7, then 6.7U1. One has USB3 and 10GB cards (to R510 Freenas) and one is totally stock with both using H700 PERC with SAS drives. I downloaded them via the R640 on Dells support site. note these are homelab systems though but maintain over 40% average load.  &amp;#x200B;  6.7 does NOT support the 5500 series CPUs."
"Negative","I look at this this way. Let's say a woman I went out with on a date when I was in my early twenties popped up out of nowhere and publicly accused me of something I didn't do. \n\nIn this climate that means career destruction. The impact is HUGE. No ""innocent until proven guilty"""

"Positive","Make sure you do proper storage projections as they are super expensive.   The software is amazing, super easy, ""Google like"" in searching for files.  Their support is very good, prompt and knowledgeable.   Ps their on-prem Exchange restore isn't baked in and NOT user friendly."
"Positive","I'd personally rather not turn the VCSA into any more of a clown car of services than it has to be, but a lightweight KMIP photon Based VM wouldn't be bad."

"Positive","Thanks for the tip - i got the distorted display, but the console was useable and its not such a hassle to flip it (i dont use the vmrc console much).  this solution fixed me issue, thx (and applies to other things that win Pro 10 does to large DPI screens).  BR/ Z"

"Positive","Not sure exactly what you're asking, but if you mean what you'd be forking over for a 3-node minimal setup, it would start at about 100 grand, I believe. This is very ""ballpark"" indeed, of course."

"Negative","Yea, it's a world of suck. I pushed too far this week."
"Negative","No one is responding over there"
"Positive","There is a slightly different method from snapshots you can use that may be the solution you are looking for.   Create your perfect starting VM then shut it down and make the disk non-persistent. Download the vmx file and use it as a template to make other cloned VMs.  You can upload as many VMs as you want, all with independent disks and pointing to the same shared VMDK.    When you want to reset, then you just reset the VM (or power it off). Just make sure the long term developers don't power theirs off or they lose their work.   The question I have though is why you need to roll back your snapshots every night?  You would need a unique base VM still for any Win2k8 servers that interact with each due to the GUIDs - just clone the first, sysprep them and do the same to each.    The more automated way would be to create a vApp and deploy them as needed using scripting at night.   On the DNS issue, I do not understand the problem.  Don't you want the new VM to have the same name and IP?"
"Positive","We are on 6.5 and will be here for at least another 6months to a year.  The bash script worked perfectly once we filled in the variables correctly(we had issues pointing to the correct FTP server) and it has been running for months.

"Negative","""Datastore > Browse datastore on the datastore to which you upload the installation media ISO image.""\nIt doesn't work even on Windows 7/Internet Explorer 11 and after installing the client plugin."
"Positive","Some versions of 5.5 may not be able to be upgraded to some versions of 6.0. So know what Update/Patch you are on and trying to go to would be helpful.  Also, the reason I ask about 6.5 is that we want to make sure that we're removing all roadblocks to getting customers to 6.5. I understand you may have a requirement for 6.0. If that can be shared, great! If not, no worries."
"Negative","Thanks for asking. I leave this page with no idea of what to choose in order to produce a VMDK for VMware or VirtualBox."
"Negative","sorry, I realised that was reply to my earlier question. I think my friend is a windows user too, so no TweetDeck"
"Negative","And unfortunately, without a snapshot prior to the hardware version 10 upgrade or backup you can't revert back."
"Negative","Instead of acting like an immature little bitch when someone offers constructive criticism you might want consider how this reaction makes the service you work hard at to provide look to potential viewers. Especially if you ever want to monetize it."

We've had cases open with VMware and Trend non-stop since our 6.0 deployments for at least 6 months now.  Nothing but a constant battle of issues of ""its not our fault, check with XX-Vendor"".

"Positive","Drivel. Zero clients handle 4 screens seamlessly (with the right host). Hell, we've got a triple widescreen demo setup in our office running games at 60fps  - the limitation is the software encoder. GPU in the client does absolutely nothing with pcoip"
"Negative","I had the same issue with VCSA update - Got stuck at exactly the same spot and I left it for about 3 hours. Came back up after a reboot, but obviously not great.  Going to try patching ESXi another day."
"Positive","http://ow.ly/jFSMx  Hear how World Wide Technology is making business transformations for their customers by partnering with VMware."
"Positive","I would monitor the cpu usage for each vm during these tasks. Allowing more resources would probably help improve things.  The shared graphics can also improve performance for certain tasks. If you have a demo video and if the scenario is simple enough to setup I could test it on one of my gpu backed vms to see if it helps much.  The biggest factor though is the latency, I would say that reducing the latency and potentially allowing more cpu resources would vastly improve the experience."

"Positive","This is looking like a pretty small environment - 2 hosts. For that, you could pretty easily get into VMware inexpensively (eg. Essentials or Essentials+).  It will be a bit more expensive than Xen, but is the gold standard with (last I read) about 65% market share."

I think I might just blow out the mega data store with the extents and try the two Data stores again tomorrow. Nothing really running on this yet. A couple of windows server VMs is all.   When I delete the large VMFS data store and create the 2 new ones, should I reboot the host in between or no need?"
"Positive","Look for new VMware ads at SFO when arriving for VMworld. Nifty IMHO. (via @herrod)"
"Negative","i have 10 x R720's running with esxi 6.7 U3 with no probs and all running with internal USB sticks.  are you running with over 512 gb ram?...these servers should be installed to disk.  just because the usb stick is new, doesnt mean it is not prone to having a problem.   i have a bad batch of patriot brand USB sticks all purchased at the same time that are all failing within weeks (7 of them have failed). previous versions of partiot sticks have worked flawlessly. all im saying is that they can fail even if new and can be batch dependent.  i am running the vmware deployed version of esxi...not the dell version."

"Negative","i have no phone  whatchu doing tonight sucka. no dane cook she sold the tickets. lamee."
"Negative"," One day the SSL certificate for VASA expired and all the VMs went offline. Never again.  The VASA provider is required for creating/removing disks and powering VMs on and off, but is not in the data path, and a failure of the provider won't cause any I/O outage. vCenter will likely show all the VMs as missing/orphaned/etc but they will continue to run until you unfuck the provider."
"Negative","Maaan i forgot i had my outline for speech due tmw"
"Negative","eh that food was ok, im gonna miss cheese doodles"
"Positive","Update Manager was not part of the VCSA, but it is now included in the appliance for 6.5.  There is no reason to go for a Windows deployment as VMware now are moving everything over to the VCSA anyway."

"Positive","AFAIK, Stanly does not offer any VMware courses that don't count towards an ICM credit. So, even if their catalog doesn't say 'vSphere 6.X Install, Configure, Manage' that is most likely what it is."
"Positive","Thanks! I'll definitely take a look at them. My only issue is getting HiveIO procured and approved. The validation process may take forever. If they're already approved for enterprise/government use, then the procurement time would significantly decrease."

"Negative","This is written for some who knows how to do stuff. But if you do not know what you are taking about this is not helpful at all.  I just need a VM  Host to hold files I need this system to be set with basic and require light touch as I am not a network of software Engineer"
"Positive","Thank you, I will use this method, I'm actually uploading the ISO from my laptop to the server. I wanted to upload the ISO from the USB Stick plugged in the server, but that's fine."
"Positive","That's what I meant - I included performance metrics on the log export.  I see 100 - 300 ms latency on the writes.  However, I can put another datastore on the same aggregate and same host and the latency is &lt; 3ms."
"Positive","Uh, what did you study? You can probably learn most of what you'd need to know on the job and it looks like they're expecting someone with no experience. That said, if you studied engineering, CS, or IT you should probably have some idea of what VMware is and what their software does."
"Negative","Same. Came here to post this. I want to at least try out the VCSA and new flows and the downloads are broken for me.   We're probably just a bit too soon."

"Positive","Workspace One overlaps nothing (I promise you).  Find any random vmware employee and ask him to show you the product and explain if they like it.  It's makes being a new employee 10000x easier."
"Positive","vCloud Availability to a service provider is another option.  As low as 5 minute RPO, way cheaper than Zerto per VM, no need to maintain your own target side equipment.

Remove the vGPU, unreserve the memory, power on successfully, power off, re-add the vGPU with a smaller profile, it doesn't prompt me to reserve all memory but I do it in Edit Resources, try to power on, and it fails the same."
"Positive","Yup...this is the correct answer.  Just power cycle the VM and it will show the correct CPU."
"Negative","Snapshot Hell. I remember this well.  One of those mistakes you only make once."
