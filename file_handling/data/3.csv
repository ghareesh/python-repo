"Positive","Just heard from an amazing customer deploying over 170K+  builds per month for CI/CD workloads all running on Virtualized MacOS on vSphere! Impressive scale"
"Positive","Thanks.  His parents were champions but he was born with a slight murmur (cleared up) and a hernia so he was no longer considered breeding material. He will be 6 in July. \n\nHe's an wonderful dog.  Except for the shedding. AKA ""German Shedder"""
"Negative","Was a &quot;slow&quot; day... I really need a job so bad  Good night, tweetworld!"
"Negative","Oh dear - your weekend not as wonderful?  (Norfolk?)"
"Positive","click on the little smiley face in the upper right corner of the html client and report it there. I was told by a vmware employee that this should go directly to the development team."
"Negative","Where are the VMC+EC2 architecture limit references? At very least there should be pointers to AWS documents for EC2 specific limits"
"Negative","My dad has lost my collage forms"
"Negative","None, I'm boycotting the web client"
"Positive","Appreciate the replies. The current vCenter server 6.5 (Windows based) will not be migrated to vCSA. Only the AD domain will be changed - Windows server running vCenter will be disjoined from old domain and joined to new domain. During this process the FQDN will have changed already. I'm unsure if the old FQDN will be buried/referenced in the vCenter DB and cause issues. If I was using a vCSA - VMware clearly state that the FQDN can't be changed and a redeploy is necessary. But for a Windows based vCenter 6.5 - unsure of same applies. The ESXi changes and SSL regeneration changes are straightforward but unsure if there are other changes required if indeed, changing the FQDN of a Windows vCenter is supported unlike the vCSA."
"Negative","Did you schedule an evening session, perhaps?  My calendar view broke when I scheduled one of the 8-midnight Hackathon sessions.  It works again if I Unschedule it.  I guess because the calendar doesn't go past 8pm?"
"Negative","daaamn, I aint even get tha chance to twit yesterday  ah nigga was busyy .. but I'm layin here in bed @ 5:48am EASTERN; still kinda tired"
"Positive","Oh, this is a great thing to know. Thanks for that brief explanation, it really helps my understanding of the naming convention for other drivers moving forward."

"Positive","Cool. MAVEN made it into Mars orbit.. Nice work @NASAJPL !!"
"Positive","- evaluate if your SRM ""plans"" will migrate accordingly, or if you need to create them again - make sure that you can use your currently installed version of SRM, with the vCenter appliance version that you choose to migrate to, otherwise you will need to reinstall on both locations - have lots of patience and read the relevant KBs"

"Negative","I'm using 4.7 and I have no Connect Via drop-down menu, nor any menu that has a Display menu"
"Negative","how was prayer? im so mad I missed the 1st one"
"Positive","We're running 6.5, I don't have many issues with it other than the slow initial load. Otherwise it works fairly reliable for us. I think the 6.5 version of the flash client is much better than previous ones.  Edit: HTML5 client is far superior, though."
"Positive","Binged Lost In Space last night and today.. Enjoyed it. Parker Posey was interesting.  Character development needs a little work.  Unlike many others, I'm SO glad it's not campy and that we didn't see a carrot man.\nSFX were great. I WANT a Chariot."
"Positive","For 12 servers I would almost argue that you are better off going with EC2 or a cloud provider instead of building your own infra. Also I can hardly fathom needing 100k to build an infra to support 12 servers unless they are intense workloads. With 100k you can build a farm to support ~200 VMs at an average size of 2/6."
"Positive","Sounds like an interesting fellow to chat with about the Christian faith.  As a fellow Christ follower, can't out give God.  May his gifts multiple many fold.    Wonder what versions of the bible he finds most interesting, maybe our paths will cross one day. ;)"
"Negative","I'm not sure what you don't agree with. I didn't ever say to take down the UAG. In fact, you never need to upgrade a UAG, you replace it with a new one if you need to upgrade them, and it can be done any time, out of band with View."
"Negative","First coat of paint is done! My stomach is still really growly and churning, I don't like it"
"Positive","On 8/26, join us for #VMwareNOW - streamed live from  #VMworld for those not at the show -  http://ow.ly/nP0NE"
"Negative","Is the share path correct? /nas/share  what are the permissions on the share? Try it wide open/777 whatever and see if it mounts."
"Positive","Plug your VCSA installation media in and select Migrate. That'll deploy a new VCSA and migrate you from your existing Windows vCenter Server. As eck79 says, vSphere Central has a dedicated section which will step you through everything you need to do."
"Positive","yeah, always something new to learn though"
"Positive","This would be a good upgrade to my i5-4570 SFF."
"Negative","Yes... that is really high... good chance something is wrong or there is failing hardware.  Performance will be very poor on that host."
"Positive","Key manager based encryption is even better in todays fluid, virtualized world."
"Negative","Sore throat + allergies = not good"
"Positive","Yes there are, but I don't have any cloud skills with VMware. So a VCP cloud is probably better than a a VCAP since it will at least give me the skills to be useful."
"Negative","Yeah, he told me the last time I talked to him in the chat....no one is ever in the chat anymore...so sad"
"Positive","we are an extremely big datacenter. We have so many managed customers and 90% of them are on vsphere 5.5 or 6.0   I have done so many vcenter upgrades in the last 9 years. I will do another one, but i feel i might wanna concentrate on the vCenter Appliance upgrade"
"Negative","900000 kbps is too high value for PCOIP to use . It is equal to 112.5 Mbps . This will be a very high value and nobody would be ready to use it if it is the case."
"Positive","I think the key is multiple sources. GPS, map data, etc. I wouldn't land a plane w/it but ""close enough"" is ok."
"Positive","I confirmed I am on 6.0 6921384. I am very interested in pursuing this. Maybe in my case using an even older or much newer image would help. I may also try a straight from VMWare image rather than a Dell image. I need to reinstall anyway as I am running out of trial time. I have not cut these into production yet due to the issues."
"Negative","This makes me so sad. I've never been to VMWorld, and I'd love to go, but damn if this didn't make me feel a bit ill. I'm really sorry to hear this."
"Negative","It's a viral bullshit rumor. Shhh you'll ruin the circlejerk."
"Negative","As a customer I dread calling support specifically because of the queue.  I have no issues with the support but the damned IVR is such a hassle."
"Negative","Some screen shots or videos would be spectacular. I've done this before on a different version, but now I can't find the ""virtual device node"" drop down menu that is referenced. Where is it? It's not really made apparent."
"Positive","Get your hands on the latest VMware HOLs to gain some technical experience. Visit Partner University today:   http://vmw.re/1rvvyZ0"
"Positive","It's not supported right now. Will be on Horizon 7.5 when it ships in VMware Q2  - which is May-July. Works as noted here so you can test.   EDIT - VMware EUC guy here."
"Negative","I know your pain. Now that we've moved our dev environment out of 2002 I need to start migrating our legacy systems. They're all on a closed SAN network (no way to tap into...they used the same IP space as my production SAN network with some of my same addresses...joy) and only have 10/100 facing outwards for VM and Management traffic. They have roughly 100 VMs they managed to create in this environment."
"Negative","No nothing is working or responding"
"Negative","i have no clue, im driving home and cant google it"
"Positive","You sign up for dreamspark with your moodle email account(The gmail one)  This nets you dreamspark access. Don't know how long it will last, my Stanly course ends July 7th.  I'll see if I still have access. I've already downloaded everything and grabbed all the keys. Great for Labbing, I have installs for every SQL server, Windows Server, Visual Studio and so on.  Yes I also grabbed VMware workstation from the Moodle site."
"Positive","So you want to run potentially unsafe software on your desktop system, but use vmware workstation and run it inside of a vm.  Don't know why you are getting downvoted, except for maybe snobbiness toward consumer questions.  Some people just don't like helping unless there's 3 SANs and 12 fiber switches involved.  Simple answer, you're fine and good job thinking to do this.  Alternatively, you can check out sandboxy.  It isolates programs without need for a vm.  If you want to be super careful, monitor and lock down outbound network connections on that machine or just disable networking altogether."
"Positive","I kinda feel like my innocence has been taken.. :) :)"
"Negative","where are you? We are all at 1898 and saying terrible things about you"
"Positive","Congrats on being #VMwareCertified Pete!!"
"Positive","VMC is managed by VMware SREs, and it has some interesting unique options (stuff like elastic DRS, elastic vSAN).     I'd model out how quickly you would burn through your azure credits. (This is hard as things like data transfer fees are painful to predict).  If it's 3 years of run rate maybe try it out. If it's 3 months meh."
"Positive","C7000's are a piece of cake, what's the issue?"
"Positive","Glad you made progress dude!  Apologies for my reply, I was just having a laugh! lol"
"Negative","I'm on the appliance, the issue though is that I'm on 6.0U3 and there's currently no upgrade path to 6.5 from 6.0U3 :("
"Positive","Why aren't you using VMtools to power down the VMs instead of WMI?  It would be more accurate...  Shutdown-VMGuest -VM $VMName -confirm:$false"
"Positive","The good news continues!  WSFC is now available in vSAN 6.7 using the iSCSI target service. Learn more: http://bit.ly/2IvpUdh"
"Positive","Get the latest infor on vCloud Hybrid Service - Disaster Recovery and other solutions launching this quarter  http://bit.ly/1jGT6HN"
"Positive","vCenter SQL has all the information in there.  It's not terribly hard to pull lots of historical information on a scheduled basis into a SQL server for reporting."
"Positive","The problem with IP HASH is it requires stacked switches.  I prefer to have A/B Separation for VSAN (Separate VLAN's that don't cross switches) and so change made to one switch can't take out both storage fabrics.  Then again I'm an old paranoid Fibre Channel Guy."
"Positive","Went out hiking. Perfect day, but a bad fall.  Still, I wanted excitement, and I got it. LOLZ"
"Positive","Thanks! Good to know it works either way."
"Negative","download option is greyed out in both edge and chrome when trying to download files from a datastrore."
"Negative","I've since learned that these things don't mean much, that case has been going on for past 3-4 years &amp; proceedings favour Zerto.   Symantec had a case against Veeam for years, likewise nobody cared and people bought it in droves (Veeam in the past few months won or case was dismissed, can't recall which, its over anyway).  I was talking to a long time EMC rep last month at an exhibition where they were both presenting and he didn't seem bothered at all as EMC have a wider and deeper product portfolio, not just replication and backup."
"Positive","Make sure you find @kmruddy and have him buy you a drink!"
"Negative","Exactly- an unsupported Enterprise array is worse than nothing.   That being said- are all your vms down? That's the real indicator of what you should be doing assuming you can't call support"
"Negative","You finally moved! Bummer. I was traveling a lot in Nov/Dec so I'm just now catching up."
"Negative","yeah. This deployment is a small one of only 4 hosts that runs some citrix stuff so it's the closest thing I have to a test environment. I ended up just writing it off and did a clean deploy and set it all up again. This is after the upgrade migration tool failed also. Can't so much do that on our main VC with close to 90 hosts..."
"Negative","concert and there wont be enough room in her car, but she said if his friend wasnt going she would totally take you. sorry"

"Negative","hey, pray for my uncle. he's in surgery right now  he gets out at noon. please make sure everything goes well"
"Positive","Awesome ideas William. I could use the IFTTT for a few other sites."
"Positive","3D printed metal engines and safer chemicals are needed to get it off the ground. :) :)"
"Negative","If anyone is installing ESXi but doesn't know how to make a USB stick bootable and boot from it, I'd question their ability to actually use the software they're installing."
"Negative","Select Plug-ins > Manage Plug-ins.\n\nWhere?  If the Plug-ins were on the main screen I wouldn't be here."
"Negative","What do you mean you can't login to the ui? I'm talking about in VMware workstation. Also the Nic needs to be e 1000 for esxi."
"Positive","As a Unidesk Certified Professional, I am sorry that you have to use it. I am not a fan of the product anymore after my experience with it. Are you guys using VMware View to broker the connection to the UD desktops? If so, do you allow sessions to stay open? I had to implement the setting on the pools in View that would automatically log off the user if the desktop session was disconnected for X minutes. This would essentially reset the session, and fixed that issue for us."
"Positive","Linked Mode.  AHHHH wouldn't that make life simple.  Unfortunately all the vCenters are from acquisitions.  So because of network issues I can get to them but they cannot get to each other.    The grand plan is to migrate everything to two VCenters primary and Secondary.  but until then I am going to be wading through drop downs.  PowerCLI is something I have thought of and I guess it would be my easiest method of working with these vcenters.  Also wouldn't hurt my personal knowledge-base in learning to use PowerCLI more often."
"Negative","The Internets are mean sometimes."
"Positive","Congrats Fabian! See you in Vegas"
"Negative","Aww  must be bad if Una can't help! Ignore him! He's not worth it!"
"Negative","i feel like death. oh, how i love being sick."
"Positive"," 10Gbps  Appreciate the perspective. I tend to want to get the best the solution can deliver vs. what is needed. Going to explore your suggestion.  Thoughts on ""fixed"" vs ""most recently used""? Reading the VMware description of ""fixed"" tells me it will fail-over if needed, only if VMware determines the ""fixed"" path at boot. If I select the path...will it not fail over to another available path?"
"Negative","My lack of motivation has defeated me"
"Positive","I'm a little unsure what the OP is talking about here. I've got half a dozen of these that I've updated and not a single one is using a ""real"" certificate. And all of them are working without problems, both HTML5 and the old client."
"Negative","Missing my roomie who is no longer my roomie"
"Positive","Thinking of replacing your data center? It's simple with #vCloudAir. Follow the link to find out more:  http://vmw.re/1Qdf4rl"
"Positive","We have two hosts running ESXI 6.0 that are currently operational.  So I'll be migrating the VMs from one host to the two new hosts that are part of the cluster."
"Positive","http://bit.ly/1ihixR3  We're providing unparalleled options for you to succeed by selling our cloud solutions. Learn how."
"Negative","Goodmorning tweeters!!! Dang, it's cloudy again...  hope it gets sunnier"
"Negative","Which beach is your head in because that's not even remotely close to what I see.  No one with an ounce of sense said VMs were dead technology and Hyper-V is universally popular with small business, which you obviously don't service.  What a bunch of shitty clickbait."
"Negative","About 2 years ago, me and a group of guys spent almost a month trying to get ArcGIS to thinapp properly, with 4.7.  We got as far as getting to work as long as we only used the thinapp package on the machine we captured it on, before or after we restored it to golden.  I believe we opened a ticket with vmware regarding it, and were basically told ""good luck, we can't figure it out"" but I can't remember for sure anymore.   So, best of luck, but I've never seen it successfully thinapped before."
"Positive","Your lucky you like over there.  GUESS WAT! DREW SENT ME A DIRECT MESSAGE!!!!"
"Negative","sos, burnin up, before the storm and its over?"
"Positive","reply reply reply  haha pweaseee"
"Positive","Thank you. I think this solved it for me. Not 100% sure though because I had also rebooted into maintenance mode as well as changed the swap location using the Web GUI.  I'm pretty sure it was the swap location and not the maintenance mode which solved my ""[Errno 28] No space left on device"" problem though. Good catch!"
"Negative","Support will usually still answer questions during the Technical Guidance phase, but unless you purchase Extended Support (very expensive) Engineering goes full Edna Mode on the product: ""I never look back darling, it distracts from the now. """
"Negative","The last sentence in the 'Note"" section appears to be incorrect.  'When your load balancer is configured to terminate SSL at the load balancer, you can deploy a second connector behind another load balancer to support certificate authentication.'  This does not seem like a valid configuration if SSL is terminated at the load balancer."
"Negative","It doesn't advise what exactly a domain is and what its purpose is."
"Negative","Quick Boot is a new option for ESXi 6.7: the new logfile is called loadESX.log. Please update this document. Thank you!"

"Positive","Barcelona... they announce 6.7 in Barcelona if I'm not wrong"
"Negative","Oh no!   I hope it works out! &lt;3 What job is proving episodic?"
"Positive","There's also an VMW office on 2nd &amp; Bryant, some of my coworkers will alternate working from there and from PA. Really depends on the team, your manager, and your role if that's doable."
"Negative","Guys how do I get it to where VMware stops locking my cd drive?"
"Negative","just found out that alcohol is not vegetarian friendly... Um what?"
"Negative","You're leaving out waaaaaaaaaay too much info for anyone to help you. Are you using ESXi5.5+? Is the VMFS datstore formatted for .vmdks of that size? etc."
"Positive","I'm not sure what the big deal is.  If you set up the machine so it doesn't use the host for time OR point the host at a time server, it should be fine.  Will it be naval observatory accurate?  No.."
"Positive","vCAC would help - you can provide users the ability to create a snapshot, and define policy for age and depth.  vCO could also do it, but you'd have to make a workflow that looked for policy violations that was invoked via a REST call or some other automated method.  Storage DRS could help with mitigating full datastores, but having good monitoring and operational policy is key.  vCAC also gives the user more visibility into what they're consuming, so they can share more responsibility for their use of resources."
"Positive","wiping out the new risk before they actually arise"
"Positive","IMHO  PVLANs do not constitute ""micro segmentation"" and I would not consider PVLAN a thing for scale.  It's good for testing - if you want to clone VMs into networks so they can talk to each other but not out to the world (ie., DC/sharepoint/etc. testing) then they're good for that.  But manageability sucks.  If you're concerned about ransomeware and PVLANs is your solution I would never want to admin that :)"
"Positive","Highlights from HP Tech Forum #hptf on @VMwareEvents and our new Events blog:  http://bit.ly/92xLFu #vmware"
"Negative","Damn it. Didn't win the nVidia Ion board."
"Negative","3 cards that all went dead on 1 port at an identical point in time? While they still light up the switch? That would be the weirdest thing I've ever seen...   I'm going to settle for having 1 port working until I can figure out what can be causing this."
"Negative","Supported operating systems haven't been updated since 2017.  Really need the documentation to be more up to date."
"Positive","Well I noticed a configuration error I made when I originally came up with a budget for this project (too many capacity ssd's). Well they approved it at the price it was and when I corrected my error and swapped the S3700's to the P3700 it actually ended up cheaper, so we are going to go with that.  As far as our workloads (70/30 r/wr), this cluster is going to be Web/DB (mysql) and an IOP hungry erp system (mssql). We've noticed from experience with this erp system, it behaves alot better the closer the vm is to the disk which was one of our main considerations when choosing vsan for this situation. I have run it over iSCSI on a 10G connection to a beefy Starwind vSAN but it just runs better on storage on the host.  As it sits now I only have one disk group on each host, but it has 2 HBA's built in so I can easily add another disk group on its own HBA in the future when I need more space. I didnt want to get the 400GB NVMe as I thought it would be better to over-provision rather than under, that would be nice though if it ran faster. We have multiple busy seasons a year and scale our web up significantly during these times, I would rather it be overkill than have everything get bogged down at the wrong time."
"Positive","Maybe there's a doggie Locks for Love I can donate to for dogs without fur?"
"Negative","Sorry dude. I didn't know these slides were being shown."
"Positive","I worked for a VAR. With our distributor there were a ton of different incentives that if we sold xxx amount of yyy we could get free vouchers."
"Positive","This seems like a good option, I'll pass it along.  Thank you!"
"Positive","@fabiorapposelli very cool Doug! Thanks for sharing & definitely a creative solution"
"Negative","got on the mothers bad side . . just got my laptop back. no phone till tomorrow"
"Positive","To me, it sounds like Mirage is what you're looking for, more so than Horizon View VDI. Mirage will allow you to ""centralize"" all your workstations and apps to a singular image with app layers4, and allow you to access the physical hardware as well. To push updates, you would simply update the OS layer, and then assign that layer to the workstations. Bam. Updated."
"Negative","We've had more candidates than I can count who couldn't get past the first question. I think we need new recruiters..."

"Positive","Thanks!  What are your thoughts on VRA over resources like Ansible, Chef, PowerCLI etc? ... I'm just about to start a dedicated VMware role next week.  one of the questions I was asked was are you happy to learn about VRA... I've never used it, or orchestrator.  There also seems to be mixed responses here on it."
"Negative","Yeah, we got downtime and moved everything to VLANs, having networks be on VLANs in name only is very dangerous security wise, and we were open for a lot of attacks."

"Negative","Turn the QNAP into a backup target or something. I'd be terrified to run my storage on a single head no matter its purpose, but I'd be less worried about a backup target going down than my primary storage."
"Negative","Same exact thing is happening to me. Been stuck at 70% for an hour. Appliance Management says it's updated but the console view of the appliance says it's still at the previous version."
"Negative","Absolutely right, given you know what you're doing to some extent.   As OP already tried and failed, he's better off with GSS. This shouldn't be something you're testing if your prod environment is already in a 'bad state'"
