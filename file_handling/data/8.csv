"Positive","You can never have too many of those wind up walking robots."
"Positive","most definitely. Been enjoying his stuff for years I tell you what."
"Negative","Under deployment there is no System Configuration"
"Positive","I don't see a problem with it, my thoughts are that the VCAP5-DCA wil be around for a while so you can do the VCAP5-DCA then do the VCAP6-Design to upgrade.  I purposely did the VCAP5 so I could then upgrade to VCIX via the Design exam."
"Negative","Oh great, food poisoning, my fave!"
"Negative","I'm awake. On a Sunday morning and at punggol. Super tired"
"Positive","VMware targets cloud and container networking with latest NSX-T launch  http://bit.ly/2nRpvbV  via @NetworkWorld"
"Negative","Pissed @ Ulric because he's leaving Friday!"
"Positive","I just got in after refreshing a bunch of times."
"Positive","http://ow.ly/n61Hr  Learn how you can increase your deal size by selling VMware vCenter Log Insight."
"Positive","These....are....awesome....  Currently using 2 stacked for the LAN connections on our hosts back to a ICX7750 via 40gb stacking and 2 for isolated iSCSI traffic."
"Negative","what a jerk!!! I'm suppose to be your fav"
"Negative","I'm not even sure that is an option anymore.  The only options you can for memory allocations global to Workstation. It looks like you can indeed select ""Fit all virtual machine memory into reserved host RAM."" But that is not the default setting."
"Negative","whoops seriously thought it was mine  my b.  I will buy you a slice sometime."
"Negative","nooooo my plans for next week just went down the drain. all booked out. damn it. waited too long."
"Negative","If you click on Download Remote Console link then it should download.\nWhy do I need to go to VMWare website???"
"Positive","You will be in breach of terms of software license with Dell.  They are not expensive to buy. Speak to your Dell rep."
"Positive","Thanks for letting me know. Now, I'm trying to figure out how to edit an existing link ..."
"Negative","And, as usual, I'm here to catch it.."
"Positive","See ya in Vegas Keith, glad you're attending"
"Positive","I always check the notes on the VM, typically the vendors put in notes about the product that differ from the types of notes we'd use ourselves.  It's not foolproof, but it's been pretty effective for me if no one else has a better way to detect it."
"Positive","Hasn't been many good shows lately, least ones we want to continue following.\n\nJust finished Breaking Bad series (again), its that good!"
"Negative","Mind if I ask where you got it? I'm after a copy of 6.0u3 and I'm running into the same issue."
"Negative","55MBps sounds really slow for a sVmotion"
"Positive","I've been talking myself out of the gym all morning  lol"
"Positive","Are you sure you need to convert it? If you connect to the vCSA with the Workstation client, can't you drag\\-drop the VM locally?  Shouldn't need to convert vSphere to Workstation, Workstation has a newer virtual hardware version capability than vSphere 6.5."
"Positive","One thing to make absolutely sure, do you want to keep snapshots on the VMs?  For developers and testers I know at least in our environment they have a 'clean' snapshot that they revert to all the time after their testing is done, or various snapshots for different stages of testing.  Most solutions (including Veeam) will not keep the snapshots.  The only two ways that I have found to keep the snapshots during migrations like this was to SCP the data from one datastore to another or vMotion the VMs."
"Negative","Wheres the part where they start charging for every feature?"
"Negative","needs to go to bed! but im not tired"
"Negative","Seems unreasonably slow. What's your ESXi build number?"
"Positive","just watched the strangers.....i am now really scared hahah"
"Positive","Whichever is easier.  Shares are that much easier than the insanity of resource pools - that get nested and added to Willy nilly then nobody understands the ramifications."
"Positive","Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. Leviticus 19:18"
"Positive","Hahahaha, that's awesome.. ""Oh, so YOU'RE his wife.... Well.... That's nice....""  haha"
"Positive","Ahh 21 future sales phone calls and emails. Good haul for one day."
"Positive","thanks Dave! You know where to reach me if you need the lifeline. ;)"
"Negative","Tracey Joy, I am soo sorry for your loss. Call me if you need anything hun."
"Positive","In 6.0 you have to use the installer. In 6.5 you should be able to deploy the OVA directly although I haven't tested it myself. If I recall, it should work.  You might try using the installer (which, by the way, in 6.5 is available for macOS and Linux) to see if you get a different result."
"Positive","solved it, i accidentally left in an extra bit of code from the old VMX file on the new line of code."
"Negative","Not blaming the hypervisor at all (although ESXi 6 is a buggy mess), doubt it's related but as I stated, it has been so long since I've built a physical Windows server.  Is it really that hard for someone to write ""Yes, I have this problem all the time, I just uncheck the following xxx updates and it seems to work"" rather than lobbing insults."
"Positive","If it's the only workload on the host right now, I'd try setting it at 16 vs 8 vs 4. I bet performance improves noticeably in your case the more vCPU you assign, you just need to find the sweet spot."
"Positive","What is you mail forwarder?  I would look at what TLS (SSL) cipher suites are enabled on that, as it may not have anything new (secure) enough for vCenter to now connect to."
"Positive","There's a good chance your SATA controller isn't on the HCL and therefore there are no drivers for it in ESXi, at least 6.5. You may have to try an older version like 6.0 or 5.5 and even then might have to do some tricks to inject the drivers into it. If you post some information about the system you'll be able to get more help."
"Positive","I have been so busy at work the past month. Check the top of the OP to find out more! Thanks!"
"Negative","Very weird, is it possible to power off the vm and migrate it to another host and try there?  Alternatively you could remove the cdrom, detach (but don't delete!) the disk, save the changes then re-add the cdrom and hard disk and see if it works afterwards? sounds like something is screwy with the vm configuration/controller config for some reason"
"Positive","Congrats to @jasemccarty for getting today's #vSANchat CrowdCaptain  https://www.crowdchat.net/chat/c3BvdF9vYmpfMjM2Nw== ..."
"Negative","99% of the sub is telling you to wait, and then repeating themselves 3x after that. These mudda fuckas know what they're talking about."
"Negative","Registry key ""Enrollment Service"" is not created even after Enrollment Server is installed.  Document should say ' You need to create ""Enrollment Service"" registry key'"
"Negative","You mean  bad physical disk on the host?"
"Positive","We're giving you 3 reasons to #virtually leave your office for the best event of the year! Learn more:  http://bit.ly/2gKfR4X ."
"Positive","RT @vCloud: In case you missed it yesterday @VMworld - VMware introduces new products including vcloud request manager  http://bit.ly/d6N6W6"
"Positive","alrighty twitter peeps.  time for bed! nighty night!"
"Positive","Correct. I assumed shared storage and vMotion / HA features."
"Positive","Amazing couple days kicking off our #vForum season in Tokyo. Headed to Singapore today, can't wait!"
"Positive","This is related to host network configuration such as vMotion, management and iSCSI. What I suggested is more in the lines of what he would need I guess."
"Positive","Congrats on the new @VMwareFusion gig!"
"Negative","@cmatiash Want to affect Global Warming? Stop destroying the Amazon."
"Negative","I've learned the hard way to not trust vibdepot's symlinks for driver and agent updates with VUM. Double-check that you are running the versions the recipe says you should be running. I pointed VUM to, I think, the September recipe agent updates, and got old versions. I had to manually import the correct version."
"Positive","That's not happening because I can't afford it - much more realistic to figure out a work-around  I think NUT is going to work... http://rene.margar.fr/2012/05/client-nut-pour-esxi-5-0/"
"Positive","Looks like veeam doesn't support our storage directly. As well we're thinking about maybe using vvols"
"Positive","Assuming you can license all those Windows installs, Xenserver!  It's free, low overhead, and runs on anything.  The performance of those VMs is going to depend on what box you're installing on though."
"Negative","I'm well but have been bitten this morning by a blooming insect in the garden  How's about you?"
"Negative","Major yikes.  Yeah, reverting a snapshot really needs to reset CBT if this is true.  Silently failing in such a way that leaves future backups corrupt is simply unacceptable!"
"Negative","awake from an effing charlie horse! note: eat a banana tomorrow. I can't walk"
"Negative","What are they doing to Moscone? I tired goggling but all I could find were stories about a construction accident and no what they were trying to do."
"Positive","You are cleared hot... --security guy"
"Negative","no details of how to set default gateway"
"Positive","I love it when I am running late &amp; out the door &amp; one of my cats makes a run for it, as if I were a bad mom."
"Negative","Yes. I'm moving to KVM and Xen."
"Positive","Pretty sure there isn't anything special. I'd do a minimal install of linux and run the client from there."
"Negative","bonfire sick but got smoke in my eyes and throat"
"Positive","Looking for a hyper-converged storage solution 40% less expensive than other solutions? Look no further than @Cisco UCS with #vSAN.  https://bit.ly/2peqtNe  #OEMamplify"
"Negative","Sad Gabe is too sick to go to his last day of school"
"Positive","You will probably have to upgrade your licenses from v6 to v6.5, but that is ""free"" with a service contract and done inside your VMWare portal."
"Positive","Definitely look at snapshot, delta and orphaned VMDK reports. Something like vCheck would server you well to get onto it. Then again, you're only going to catch the issue when you get in Monday morning."
"Positive","IRC buddy! I'm pretty sure we've still got an internal instance some where haha"
"Positive","alex! i miss u  its been way too long. give boo a hug and kiss for me and when i get back we are hanging out! Friday!!!!! xoxox"
"Negative","Man, am I the only one who had a shit time at VMworld last year? Like... I just couldn't get in the vibe of anything. 1st VMworld and I left like, ""I wasted a week in SFO partying and not learning much."" I kinda blame my TAM but huh... maybe it's just me? Parties are literally the only reason to go! .&lt;"
"Positive","No they're not. This was stated very clearly at VMUG by VMware employees when asked. VMware has chosen Flash and plan to stick with it. No HTML5 web client is currently being developed.   I had lunch on VMware at my office Tuesday and they reiterated this point as well  when outrsecurity guy bitched he had to have flash installed just for VMware."
"Positive",": CHUCK!! I so want to watch it but I haven't got a chance  How is it? Is it good?  You should watch Gossip Girl too :p"
"Negative","My Internet is down!!!! I might acutally die!"
"Negative","*hugs*  I'm so sorry.. anything I can do?"
"Positive","The U.S. needs to prioritize #STEM education across K-12 and higher ed to remain an innovative #tech leader.  http://bit.ly/2jzNjgN"
"Negative","I meant it was really hard to tal to people  Mean. I tried to clarify but it all went wrong."
"Positive","I think you're going to be just fine then."
"Positive","I did the opposite, I had vSphere experience and started a new job in a Hyper-V. Lemme tell ya, going from Hyper-V to VMware is a whole lot easier than the other way around :)"
"Positive","Curious about how you can benefit from the newly announced VMware Partner Professional Services Program? Start here:  http://vmw.re/1IWOcrP"
"Positive"," You must not not create a hardware RAID 0 volume (or any RAID!) across multiple disks to then be consumed by vSAN.  That's the key bit of information that wasn't in the guide. thanks!"
"Positive","Nice video.  Did you run into any gotchas? Also, when in this process did you upgrade vCenter?"
"Positive","You only JUST realized this??\n\n:)"
"Positive","You shouldn't be quiescing the SQL database in my view. If you want to back that up, use an agent within the guest OS and snapshot the OS itself at a separate time, filtering any independent disks."
"Positive","Actually....I put in my 2 weeks notice to leave 2 days ago. Got a job at VCU."
"Negative","Fireplaces are inefficient. Thinking a very small pellet stove. Direct vent. But that's going to be $$ :("
"Positive","This is why this problem continues to cause confusion.  While neither article is really wrong in the larger question of performance, neither article really answers the question fully.  Mr Denneman's article appears to zero in on what core you will be accessing. In other words, if I tell the system there are two sockets, that does not ""force"" the scheduler to use cores from two different sockets.  The article you linked, does a great job of highlighting the problems of memory access performance when you have large VMs that actually span multiple hardware NUMA nodes.  In short, I wouldn't say the article from Achtemichuk counters. I would say it expands on maybe? I'm not sure. Either way, it's a hefty discussion and one that needs to happen more often. We have not seen CPU ready errors caused by how VMs are allocated sockets and cores, but we have seen OLTP DBs affected by badly designed large VMs spanning physical NUMA nodes."
"Negative","Ok i am officially blind. I wouldn't care but it's making me poor!!"
"Positive","I'd love to hear about those use cases (specifically around presenting SAN LUNs), because I haven't run into one yet."
"Positive","Thanks! So I had the right idea with the switch aspect, cool. Yeah I'll use a standard vSwitch, that makes sense."
"Positive","This is what I did as well; moved the vcenter server and database servers to the same host and logged into that directly.  Took SQL backups via NBU, as well as VDP full VM backups of both servers. I also took last minute snapshots of each before beginning, but luckily didn't need any of it. Took a few hours, but everything went mostly smoothly."
"Negative","Oh my look at the time! Best go get a soaking  me poor hair! just had it done yesterday ! a give up! wish a was a bloke at times!"
"Positive","You still lose the entire group if you pull the wrong drive. You are not wrong though. I have zero issues with VSAN overall, but statements like the above are not correct. Modern storage arrays are fine to. HCI has its place and will only grow."
"Positive",".@vDerekS @itzikr We've had several scripts over past-VMworld. I'm pretty sure  someone will throw something up real soon :)"
"Positive","Dell PowerEdge R730. Sounds like a good plan. I will check logs on the host."
"Positive","We know there are almost too many clouds to count. At #VMworld, we're looking at bridging the gaps between them.  http://bddy.me/2bm1xuc"
"Positive","I've used SRM as a customer, and now I'm on the EMC team that covers Enterprise Hybrid Cloud (which uses vRA/SRM/Recoverpoint for DRaaS). SRM takes some work, but failing over without it in a large environment is rough.   How many VMs will you have to protect, and what are your plans to handle the networking?"
"Positive","The new theme is only available for the fling at this time."
"Negative","I haven't used the voucher yet. Thanks for the heads up.  I should have said that I find it impossible to read on electronic media so I am looking to get the physical copy. Regardless I am finding the eBook to be only $10 cheaper.  In addition my library offers the book via Safari but honestly that is impossible to use."
"Negative","Every weekend feels like politics. Full of strategies, manipulations and dominations. God I miss my simple weekends"
"Positive","VCP is now two exams,  an online exam on general vSphere and a sit down just like now on the specific track.     This lets the sit-down exam be scaled (time and questions) back closer to the older VCP exams."
"Positive","Good luck. Keep in mind that unless you can provide them with a username and password that has the capability to modify the system they won't be able to assist you with much."
"Positive","RT @vCloud: @VMware CMO Rick Jackson notes roughly 19,000 attendees. Thanks Diamond,Platinum sponsors & all of our @VMware_Partners #keynote"
"Positive","PDQ Deploy is a lot easier to use and less hardware needed.  I used to be an SCCM Admin and I prefer using it as oppose to using the 800lb beast.  In a VMWare envionrment you don't need image management, you do need app and automation tools and PDQ can handle everything I need to manage deployed persistent VMs."
"Positive","Wat a nice day it was 2day!me and rachel decided to walk to work and walk back lol..was so warm inside tho"
"Positive","Very helpful thanks! I see that in the contents doc for the 12.0.1115.0 driver so that makes sense to me that the SPP is delayed and its published early on the VMware HCL. Looks like the June update still holds the 11.4.1205.0 driver where as the HCL is reporting 11.4.1255.0 as being supported. That still confuses me.   I'll probably be deploying the 12.x version anyways if I'm going to be updating."
"Positive","For one customer, #VSAN ""took processing from 45 minutes to 5 minutes"":  http://vmw.re/1OoLtZY   http://fb.me/3MGv3m8T7"

"Negative","Why are dentist whitenings better than shop bought ones? They all claim online to be same as dentist treatment, but they rarely are value"
"Positive","Also, reading your post again, if you need a datastore, you will have to create a datastore, empty drive is required for that but just that alone won't do it, you will have to go to the ESX host and create the datastore on the disk."
"Positive","I understand your reservation but I've had to do it several times due to flaky stuff like you're experiencing. As long as you have not made network changes that cut off it's access to the management network everything should be ok. Are you running it as a VM or is it a standalone server?"
"Negative","It happens pretty much seconds after I click power on, the error I get on the BSOD is ""kernel security check failure"", I've checked both my drivers and BIOS for updates since that seems to fix that particular BSOD for others, but no luck. :/   Weirdly, I can run virtualbox just fine, this is purely isolated to VMware, which I don't understand at all."
"Positive","Drop it down further like 2 vcpu (in virtual world less is more)"
"Negative","Our DDS team rides our asses on patches.  We don't go long without them.  We are doing it several times a year so I don't feel so bad.  Certainly no 1k+ day up times!  That is ridiculous."
"Positive","not yet  turned out to be a super busy summer so far. girl needs her siesta!"
"Positive","Working on our family farm gave me a clear sense of the value of work. Why leaders should know what made them:  http://bit.ly/2chzaBq"

"Positive","Register for the 10/18 vForum Online & learn how vSAN paves the way to the Modern Datacenter. Register now.  http://bit.ly/2gJkH2r"
"Positive","HTML5 implementation does suck, I've used IE11 (it's installed on Win10) and the flash version when I've had too. But I'm running 6.0, so can use the Windows client, which is 100 times better."
"Positive","no, you don't have to worry about that unless you join a zoom conference or something from your actual home desktop and share instead of in your horizon session"
"Positive","great. Would like to catch up if we can find the time."
"Negative","That has been my experience as well. I tried installing the hp VIB packages and got a PSOD.  I've also gotten PSOD's on 5.5u3 that came with the hp tools bundled.  Basically it's a rotten shitshow."
"Positive","Apparently it's not too easy to increase disk space of root in 6.5. I ended up pointing the backup set to /storage where I had a lot of space available, and that seems to have done the trick."
"Positive","Thank you Sir. Just wanted to check on the difference."
"Negative","Finally someone said it.  I read this and just went, ""Why?""  If replacing the web cert is that important to you, then replace it with an internal CA.  If it's for a lab... well, if you like misery, then go nuts?"
"Positive","Didn't know that since I hadn't worked with NFS, thanks for the insight!"
"Negative","there is no information on that page - just four bullet items with no explanation"
"Positive","Those other hosts are blades as well?  If you look through the VMkernel log you should be able to find a SCSI Sense code related to the event."
"Negative","Not concrete enough for the different scenarios"
"Positive","No routing for security reasons is a thing. Being unable to have access to a NTP/DNS server is another one :)  On which network are the ""management networks""  of the ESXi for now ?"
"Positive","You can upgrade the licenses as you need them for your upgrade to 6, *as long as you had been paying for support on those licenses*. So, as long as you  guys are still under support with VMWare, there won't be any cost.   Your order is correct, although I don't think there is a separate license for Update Manager.  You'll login to the VMWare website and select your vCenter 5.5 license then select upgrade. Once done you'll be emailed the key as well as the 6 key will then show up in 'My VMware'. Import that key, perform the update, apply the key."
"Positive","Project Hatchway - Persistent Storage for Cloud Native Applications  https://vmware.github.io/hatchway/  <-looks interesting!"
"Positive","Learn about the new labs offered at #VMwarePEX. We'll have over 30 lab topics with 100+ modules for you to explore.  http://bit.ly/1edQq5Y"
"Positive","I have done it before without having any issues but every environment is different and you never know what could happen.   When in doubt call copilot they are always helpful.   You Could always do it during a maintenance window. Could save you a ton of time then double svmotion."
"Positive","Never P2V'd Vista before.  Sounds an issue with the video drivers.  Did you have converter install VMware Tools?  If not, see if he can boot it into safe mode and install VMware Tools."
"Positive","This is its normal behavior. To get more detailed feedback, try finishing the Powershell block in your remote script with ConvertTo-Json and then converting it back in your local session.  $Script = ""Some-RemoteCommand | ConvertTo-Json"" $Output = Invoke-VMScript -ScriptText $Script -VM MyVM -HostCredential $HostCredential -GuestCredential $GuestCredential $Output | ConvertFrom-Json"
"Positive","yeah, it is a great one. too bad there's no linux version"
"Negative","I've used OVMM for a couple months : is a big piece of shit.  It's VirtualBox with a ugly-not-functional web console and management architecture.  As I remember, if you want to add a virtual disk to a vm, you must create the virtual disk in a dedicated menu screen, then move to vm management screen, then attach the previously created virtual disk."
"Positive","Same here.. We'll be in touch I'm sure tho. It's a small industry."
"Positive","I have to watch the first to make sure it looks decent :) but I'm with you. I try to avoid further trailers after I've decided"
"Negative","is sick with worry...wishing I knew if he was ok...and of course, why would the story be on the news? Its just troops in Iraq"
"Positive","#HPOneView has sold over 100K licenses! Find out how #VMware integrations put power and efficiency in easy reach:  http://vmw.re/1FwXqqy"

"Negative","Just had my first bit of spam on Flickr!"
"Positive","Please do! Spend the night so you don't have to drive. We can talk about that project and you can expense it. :)"

"Positive","We always wanted to have something in place which reduces the workloads and this certainly helped up in doing the same"
"Negative","With consumer grade SSDs a hard reboot can loose data in the write buffer (why they are not certified).  They lack power loss protection.  I've caused a LOT of network partitions over the years. Writes are not ack's to the VM until the DOM owner gets a clean write ack from all hosts."

"Positive",".... oh in that case, let me book my flight now then ;)"
"Negative","Yea: DONT!  I've done it once and it was not as simple as I thought. I don't think its even supported by VMware (you really need to check)   I would move my VMs (If you for some random stupid reason have them on the same subnet) first and just setup a new subnet and new hosts and vCenter."

"Positive","What is scary about updating. We have had some less than stellar upgrade experiences due to what was a semi poorly documented known issue. But overall its normally very smooth.  I manage about 16 different UCS domains across all our sites. So we have been able to prrform a lot of updates."
"Positive","aw man. You need to get some media exposure on this. Shed some light on them."
"Positive","This was the one thing that stuck out to me as well.  If the new scheduler gets back most of the performance then I may be able to finally turn on the L1TF mitigations and get the security guys off my back."
"Negative","would have done it but london is too too far from home  xx"
"Positive","How many VMs for how many hosts? If it's a small operation you'll probably be fine without DRS (IMO). Regarding moving VMs during business hours vs non-business hours...If your cluster is set up correctly you won't notice anything when the VM moves to another host using regular vMotion or DRS to do it for you. So move items whenever you need to."
